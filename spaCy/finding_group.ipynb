The original edition bears a dedication to Gottfried Baron van Swieten1 (1734-1803), Prefect of the Royal Library, Vienna, and sometime Austrian Ambassador in Berlin, a friend of Haydn and Mozart, patron of Beethoven, a man whose age allowed him to have seen Bach, and whose career makes the association with Bach that Forkel's dedication gives him not undeserved. It was he, an ardent Bach enthusiast, who introduced the youthful Mozart to the music of the Leipzig Cantor. “I go every Sunday at twelve o'clock to the Baron van Swieten,” Mozart writes in 1782, “where nothing is played but Handel and [pg xiii]Bach, and I am now making a collection of the Fugues of Bach.” The merit and limitations of Forkel's book will be considered later.
