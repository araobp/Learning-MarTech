       " Johann Nikolaus Forkel, author of the monograph \n",
       " of which the following pages afford a translation, \n",
       " was born at Meeder, a small village in Saxe-Coburg, on February 22, 1749, seventeen months \n",
       " before the death of Johann Sebastian Bach, whose \n",
       " first biographer he became.  Presumably he would \n",
       " have followed the craft of his father, the village \n",
       " shoemaker, had not an insatiable love of music \n",
       " seized him in early years.  He obtained books, \n",
       " and studied them with the village schoolmaster. \n",
       " In particular he profited by the <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“Vollkommener\n",
       " Kapellmeister”</span> of Johann Mattheson, of Hamburg, \n",
       " the sometime friend of Handel.  Like Handel, \n",
       " he found a derelict Clavier in the attic of his home \n",
       " and acquired proficiency upon it.  \n",
       " Forkel's professional career, like Bach's half a \n",
       " century earlier, began at Lüneburg, where, at the \n",
       " age of thirteen (1762), he was admitted to the choir \n",
       " of the parish church.  Thence, at the age of \n",
       " seventeen (1766), he proceeded to Schwerin as <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“Chorpräfect,”</span> and enjoyed the favour of the \n",
       " Grand Duke.  Three years later he betook himself (1769), at the age of twenty, to the University\n",
       " <span class=\"tei tei-pb\" id=\"pagex\">[pg x]</span>\n",
       " of Göttingen, which he entered as a law student, \n",
       " though a slender purse compelled him to give \n",
       " music lessons for a livelihood.  He used his opportunity \n",
       " to acquire a knowledge of modern languages, \n",
       " which stood him in good stead later, when his \n",
       " researches required him to explore foreign literatures.  \n",
       " Concurrently he pursued his musical activities, \n",
       " and in 1774 published at Göttingen his first \n",
       " work, <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Ueber die Theorie der Musik,</span></span> advocating \n",
       " the foundation of a music lectureship in the University.  \n",
       " Four years later (1778) he was appointed \n",
       " its Director of Music, and from 1779 to 1815 conducted \n",
       " the weekly concerts of the Sing-Akademie.  \n",
       " In 1780 he received from the University the \n",
       " doctorate of philosophy.  The rest of his life was \n",
       " spent at Göttingen, where he died on March 17, \n",
       " 1818, having just completed his sixty-ninth \n",
       " year.\n",

       " That Forkel is remembered at all is due solely \n",
       " to his monograph on Bach.  Written at a time \n",
       " when Bach's greatness was realised in hardly any \n",
       " quarter, the book claimed for him pre-eminence \n",
       " which a tardily enlightened world since has conceded \n",
       " him.  By his generation Forkel was esteemed \n",
       " chiefly for his literary activity, critical ability, and \n",
       " merit as a composer.  His principal work, <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik,</span></span> was published in \n",
       " two volumes at Leipzig in 1788 and 1801.  Carl \n",
       " Friedrich Zelter, Goethe's friend and correspondent, \n",
       " dismissed the book contemptuously as that of\n",
       " <span class=\"tei tei-pb\" id=\"pagexi\">[pg xi]</span>\n",
       " an author who had <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“set out to write a history of \n",
       " music, but came to an end just where the history \n",
       " of music begins.”</span>  Forkel's work, in fact, breaks \n",
       " off at the sixteenth century. But the curtailed <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\n",
       " History</span></span> cleared the way for the monograph on \n",
       " Bach, a more valuable contribution to the literature \n",
       " of music.  Forkel already had published, in \n",
       " three volumes, at Gotha in 1778, his <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Musikalisch-kritische Bibliothek,</span></span> and in 1792 completed his \n",
       " critical studies by publishing at Leipzig his <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Allgemeine Literatur der Musik.</span></span>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"tei tei-p\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1.00em\">\n",
       " Forkel was also a student of the music of the \n",
       " polyphonic school.  He prepared for the press the \n",
       " scores of a number of sixteenth century Masses, \n",
       " Motets, etc., and fortunately received proofs of \n",
       " them from the engraver.  For, in 1806, after the \n",
       " Battle of Jena, the French impounded the plates \n",
       " and melted them down.  Forkel's proofs are still \n",
       " preserved in the Berlin Royal Library.  He was \n",
       " diligent in quest of Bach's scattered MSS., and his \n",
       " friendship with Bach's elder sons, Carl Philipp \n",
       " Emmanuel and Wilhelm Friedemann, enabled him \n",
       " to secure precious relics which otherwise might \n",
       " have shared the fate of too many of Bach's manuscripts.  \n",

Inserting them, he got hold of the book, rolled it up, and drew it out.  As he was not allowed a candle, he could only copy it on moonlight nights, and it was six months before he finished his heavy task.  As soon as it was completed he looked forward to using in secret a treasure won by so much labour.

Yet in Bach's case we should be wrong to acclaim as masterpieces all the products of his great activity just because masterpieces at length were the fruit of it.

Indeed, he actually attempted to improve some of them that were already perfect.  Any that were susceptible of improvement he improved, even those already engraved.  Such is the origin of the variant readings of his works found in older and more recent texts.  By constantly retouching his compositions Bach aimed at making them indisputable masterpieces.

The Count was a great invalid and suffered from insomnia.  Goldberg lived in the Ambassador's house, and slept in an adjoining room, to be ready to play to him when he was wakeful.  One day the Count asked Bach to write for Goldberg some Clavier music of a soothing and cheerful character, that would relieve the tedium of sleepless nights.  Bach thought a set of Variations most likely to fulfil the Count's needs, though, on account of the recurrence of the same basic harmony throughout, it was a form to which he had hitherto paid little attention.  Like all his compositions at this period, however, the Variations are a masterpiece, and are the only example he has left us of this form.<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_239\" id=\"noteref_239\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">239</span></span></a> The Count always called them <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“my Variations”</span> and was never weary of hearing them.

But Bach employed other methods which are less easy to describe because they are more subtle.  He often rivets the style and character of a piece by changing a single note, strictly correct grammatically and yet disagreeable to an artist such as himself.  Even commonplace passages he could convert into phrases of beauty by the addition or alteration of a single note.  Only the most sensitive taste and trained experience can decide in such cases, and Bach possessed both in the highest perfection.  He developed them to such a pitch, indeed, that his brain eventually rejected any idea which, in all its properties and relations, did not accord inevitably and naturally with the whole composition.  Consequently his later works display such consistency of merit that all of them seem to have been cast complete in a mould, so smooth, facile and abundant is the flow of his rich fancy.

The very ease with which genius acquires and applies the apparatus of musical composition frequently entices it to leap over root principles in its plunge into deeper waters, or to fly before its wings are grown.  In such a case, unless genius is guided back to neglected fundamentals and forced to build itself upon the great examples of the past, it will inevitably expend its treasure uselessly and never attain to its promised dimensions.

Nothing is more intellectually stimulating than counterpoint, and the composers Bach studied were distinguished by their mastery of it, as their fugal writing attests.

He could count on the applause of all who understood good music, and never failed to receive it.  Under what other conditions can sound works of art emerge?  The composer who debases his muse to the popular mood either lacks real genius or, having it, abuses it.  For to catch the ear of the public is not a difficult task and merely connotes an agreeable facility.  Composers of that class are like artisans who frankly fashion their goods to suit their market.

It does not arrest our attention momentarily but grips us the stronger the oftener we listen to it, so that after a thousand hearings its treasures are still unexhausted and yield fresh beauties to excite our wonder.  Even the beginner who knows but the A B C of his art warms with pleasure when he hears Bach's music and can open his ear and heart to it.  It was the true artist spirit, too, that guided Bach to unite majesty and grandeur of design with meticulous care for detail and the most refined elegance, characteristics which we rather seek, perhaps, in works whose object is merely to give pleasure.

Of this number he composed at least thirty before 1723.  Hence approximately 265 were written at Leipzig.  But Bach's fertility does not appear to have outlived the year 1744.  We have reason, therefore, to conclude that the 265 Leipzig Cantatas were written in the course of twenty-one years, that is, between 1723 and 1744.  To complete that number Bach must have composed a new Cantata every month, a surprising but demonstrable conclusion.\n",

For 1731 about twenty survive, of which half a dozen may belong to 1732, a deduction which still preserves Bach's steady average.  In 1735 he produced actually nineteen Cantatas between the New Year and the following November, though not all of them are positively dated.  Thereafter his activity is less certainly measured.  But from 1736 till the end of 1744 he composed fifty-three Cantatas, at the rate, that is, of at least six every year, without making allowance for Cantatas written and lost.\n",

The man was a close friend, godfather of Bach's eldest daughter, Katharina Dorothea (b. 1708), chief pastor of the Church of the Blessed Virgin, and Consistorial Assessor, at Mühlhausen.  He was, moreover, an aggressive foe of Pietism, of which Mühlhausen was the citadel, and Bach's minister, Frohne, the protagonist.  Indeed, the two men waged so public and wordy a warfare<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_365\" id=\"noteref_365\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">365</span></span></a> that Bach's social relations with the one and official connection with the other must have been rendered difficult.

To him undoubtedly we must attribute the cold austerity of the three Mühlhausen libretti and the suppression of the personal note already sounded in Bach's Arnstadt Cantata.

Nor do they express the reflective or prayerful mood that reveals Bach.

In a word, they suggest the work of a preacher casting his sermon notes into lyrical form, an impression which is strengthened by the fact that the libretto invariably opens with a Scripture passage and frequently blends the Gospel and Epistle for the Day in one harmonious teaching.

The elder was Pastor of the Church from 1714 till his death in 1737.  He was a cultured man, in touch with the University, and possibly formed a link between it and Bach, to whom he showed greater cordiality than the Cantor received from other clerical colleagues.

There is sufficient evidence, therefore, that Bach's relations with the elder Weiss were intimate enough to support a literary partnership.  Moreover, circumstances lend weight to the inference.  For some years before Bach's arrival in Leipzig, Weiss suffered from an affection of the throat which kept him from the pulpit.  But, during the first year of Bach's Cantorate, he was able to resume his preaching.  If he was, in fact, the author of the libretti, we can have little difficulty in concluding that they and his sermons were built on the same text.\n",

       " accepted.  But its correctness may be contested.  It is suspicious, to begin with, that Picander never published the texts which Spitta asserts him to have poured out in such profusion. <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“He placed no value,”</span> Spitta answers readily, <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“on these manufactured compositions, put together hastily to please his friend.”</span>  But the argument cannot stand.  Why should Picander have thought less of libretti actually used by his <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“incomparable Capellmeister”</span> than of those published for and rejected by him?—for Spitta does not venture to declare that as literature the rejected were superior to the accepted texts.  If out of a published cycle of libretti expressly written for him Bach chose only eight texts, are Picander's <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“manufactured compositions,”</span> as Spitta calls them, likely to have attracted him to a greater degree?  We can detect his hand perhaps in six Cantatas<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_440\" id=\"noteref_440\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">440</span></span></a> besides those already mentioned, and Bach relied on him exclusively for his secular texts.  One concludes, none the less, that Bach rarely accepted an original Cantata libretto from Picander, and employed him chiefly on the Choral Cantatas of his latest period.  Excluding them, and adding the probable to the actual original Picander texts, they total only twenty-one, a fraction inadequate to support Spitta's sweeping statement.\n",

       " From the advent of Picander in 1725, to the end of the first Leipzig period nine years later, Bach does not seem to have gone outside the circle of familial authors for his regular Cantata texts.  On October 17, 1727, however, he produced a funeral Cantata, or <span class=\"tei tei-q\">“Trauer-Musik,”</span> in memory of the late Queen of Poland, the libretto of which was written by Professor J. C. Gottsched.

All but one (No. 68) of the libretti conclude with a Choral, and their Arias are hymn-like in metre.  The tone of them, however, is warmer, more personal, less didactic than the Weiss texts.

       " That Bach should have turned to Lutheran hymnody, chiefly of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that the Cantatas built upon it should be his most perfect religious work is not surprising.  The hymns and their melodies were the foundations upon which the temple of German Protestantism had been reared.  They appealed vividly and powerfully to Bach's spiritual nature, and profoundly influenced his musical utterance.  His whole career, as Sir Hubert Parry points out,<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_453\" id=\"noteref_453\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">453</span></span></a> was an effort to widen his means for self-expression.  And the Choral Cantata, in effect, was the reconciliation or blending of this self-discipline.  It was the supreme achievement of Bach's genius to assert the faith and idealism of Lutheran hymnody with the fullest resources of his technique.\n",

       " It is not our task to consider the hymn libretto in its relation to the structure of Bach's latest Cantatas.  Necessarily it tied him to a stereotyped design, which he clung to with greater persistency because it exactly fulfilled his devotional purpose.  But experience compelled him, after a brief trial, to discard the simple hymn libretto.  In the earlier Leipzig years as many as eight Choral Cantatas<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_454\" id=\"noteref_454\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">454</span></span></a> are set to the unaltered text of a congregational hymn.

Bach, in fact, soon realised that, while the unaltered hymn-stanza, with its uniform metre and balanced rhyme, was appropriate to the simple Choral or elaborate Fantasia, it was unmalleable for use as an Aria or Recitative.  Hence, retaining the unaltered Hymn-stanza for the musical movements\n",
       " <span class=\"tei tei-pb\" id=\"page183\">[pg 183]</span>\n",

And it is significant that Picander's hand is visible in the libretto.  The next example<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_457\" id=\"noteref_457\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">457</span></span></a> occurs three years later, and again reveals Picander's authorship.

But in the second Leipzig period, after his collaboration with Marianne von Ziegler, he arrived at and remained constant to a uniform design.  Of the thirty-nine Choral Cantatas of the whole period only two exhibit the earlier form.  Of all the others the libretto consists partly of unaltered hymn-stanzas—invariably used for the first and last movements, and occasionally elsewhere—but chiefly of paraphrased stanzas of the hymn, whose accustomed melody, wherever else it may be introduced, is associated invariably with the hymn when the text is used in its unaltered form.  We, to whom both words and melody are too frequently unfamiliar, may view the perfections of the Choral Cantata with some detachment.  But Bach's audience listened to hymns and tunes which were in the heart of every hearer and a common possession of them all.

Like his father, he was Bach's colleague, the godfather of his daughter, and undoubtedly on terms of close friendship with him.  But if he wrote the libretto of Cantata No. 38, probably it is not the only one.

       " But, as was said at the outset, the attribution of particular libretti to individual writers is conjectural, except in comparatively few cases.  Yet, unsatisfying as it is, this guess-work reveals with approximate correctness the extent to which Bach drew upon his own and other people's abilities for the texts he needed.  Summarising our conclusions, we discover that about one-quarter (fifty-four) of the 202 libretti set by Bach between the years 1704 and 1744 were provided by the hymn-book.  It is shown elsewhere<a class=\"pginternal\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35041/pg35041-images.html#note_475\" id=\"noteref_475\"><span class=\"tei tei-noteref\"><span style=\"font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super\">475</span></span></a> that all but eleven of them are taken from Paul Wagner's volumes.  The elder Weiss comes next with thirty-three libretti.  Bach follows with thirty, Salomo Franck with twenty-one, Picander with twenty (exclusive of his arrangements of Choral Cantata texts).  Marianne von Ziegler contributes ten, Neumeister seven, Eilmar and Helbig two each, Gottsched and Martin Behm one each.  Three libretti are taken from the Bible or Church liturgy.  Eighteen remain anonymous.\n",

       " The literary qualities of the libretti are not under discussion here.  They have a characteristic, however, on which one cannot forbear from remarking.  Indifferent literature as, for the most part, they are—children of their period and blemished with its imperfections—they enshrine an extraordinarily interesting anthology of the religious poetry of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.  They expose the evangelical thought of Germany from the age of Luther to that of Bach,\n",
       " <span class=\"tei tei-pb\" id=\"page186\">[pg 186]</span>\n",
       " and are particularly rich in the lyrical fervour of the Reformation itself.  Of the seventy-seven hymn-writers whom Bach includes in his collection, so many as forty-four belong to the sixteenth century.  Only thirteen of them touch Bach's own period.  And a similar bias to the Reformation epoch is observable in his choice of the tunes of the Chorals, which are absent from only twenty-one of the Cantatas.  By far the greater number of them are coeval with the hymns themselves; that is, they date from the Reformation and behind it.\n",

       " The Bachgesellschaft was founded on December 15, 1850, issued its first volume in 1851, and was dissolved on January 27, 1900, upon the publication of its sixtieth and concluding volume.  The Society had fulfilled its fundamental purpose—the publication of Bach's works—and on the very date of its dissolution the Neue Bachgesellschaft was founded with the object of popularising Bach's music by publishing it in practicable form and by holding Bach Festivals.  A secondary object, the foundation of a Bach Museum at Eisenach, in the house in which Bach was born, already has been achieved.  Bach Festivals have been held at regular intervals—at Berlin in 1901, Leipzig in 1904, Eisenach—in connection with the opening of the Museum—in 1907, at Chemnitz in 1908, Duisburg in 1910, Breslau in 1912, Vienna in 1914.  The publications of the new Society necessarily are unimportant by the side of those of its predecessor.

Marpurg published, in 1786, the story, which he received from Bach himself, that on one of his journeys from Hamburg, Bach sat down outside an inn and hungrily sniffed the savours from its kitchen.  His pockets were empty and there seemed little prospect of a meal, when a window was opened and two herring heads were thrown out.

That a professed historian of music, setting before the public for the first time the life of one whom he so greatly extolled, and with every inducement to present as complete a picture of him as was possible, should have taken no trouble to carry his investigations beyond the point C.

The only reason that can be adduced, apart from the lack of a really scientific impulse, is that Forkel was almost entirely ignorant of the flood of concerted church music which poured from Leipzig from 1723 to 1744.

It is, however, exceedingly doubtful whether Bach wrote more than four <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Passions.</span></span>  Only those according to St. Matthew and St. John have come down to us from C. P. E. Bach, who was left the Autographs of both by his father.  The <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">St. John Passion</span></span> was first performed in 1724 and the <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">St. Matthew Passion</span></span> in 1729. Picander, Bach's librettist, certainly wrote two other Passion texts, one of which was written for Good Friday 1725, and the second, based on St. Mark's Gospel, was actually performed at St. Thomas', Leipzig, on Good Friday 1731.  Spitta (ii. 505) gives good reason to hold that Bach's music for this Passion was adapted from the <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Trauer-Ode,</span></span> which he had written in 1727 in memory of Queen Christiane Eberhardine.  But of the 1725 <span class=\"tei tei-title\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Passion</span></span> there is no trace.  If it ever existed, its loss probably may be assigned to Wilhelm Friedemann's carelessness, to whom presumably it was assigned in the division of Bach's property after his death.

It is published by Breitkopf and Haertel, but is generally regarded as being by another composer than Bach, who probably copied it for use at Leipzig.

For six successive generations scarcely two or three of its members are found whom nature had not endowed with remarkable musical talent, and who did not make music their profession.',\n",
       " 'Veit Bach, ancestor of this famous family, gained a livelihood as a baker at Pressburg in Hungary.  When the religious troubles of the sixteenth century broke out he was driven to seek another place of abode, and having got together as much of his small property as he could, retired with it to Thuringia, hoping to find peace and security there.  He settled at Wechmar, a village near Gotha, where he continued to ply his trade as a baker and miller.In his leisure hours he was wont to amuse himself with the lute,playing it amid the noise and clatter of the mill.  His taste for music descended to his two sonsand their children, and in time the Bachs grew to be a very numerous family of professional musicians,Cantors, Organists, and Town Musicians,throughout  Thuringia.',\n",
       " \"Not all the Bachs, however, were great musicians.  But every generation boasted some of them who were more than usually distinguished.  In the first quarter of the seventeenth century three of Veit Bach's grandchildren showed such exceptional talent that the Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt thought it worth while to send them at his expense to Italy, then the chief school of music, to perfect themselves in the art.\",\n",
       " \"We do not know whether they rewarded the expectations of their patron, for none of their works has survived. The fourth generationof the family produced musicians of exceptional distinction,and several of their compositions, thanks to Johann Sebastian Bach's regard for them, have come down to us. The most notable of these Bachs are:\",\n",
       " 'Besides these three men, the Bachs boasted several able composers in the generations preceding Johann Sebastian, men who undoubtedly would have obtained higher positions, wider reputation, and more brilliant fortune if they could have torn themselves from their native Thuringia to display their gifts elsewhere in Germany or abroad. But none of the Bachs seems to have felt an inclination to migrate. Modest in their needs, frugal by nature and training, they were content with little, engrossed in and satisfied by their art, and wholly indifferent to the decorations which great men of that time were wont to bestow on artists as special marks of honour. The fact that others who appreciated them were thus distinguished did not rouse the slightest envy in the Bachs.',\n",
       " \"The Bachs not only displayed a happy contentedness, indispensable for the cheery enjoyment of life, but exhibited a clannish attachment to each other.  They could not all live in the same locality.  But it was their habit to meet once a year at a time and place arranged beforehand.  These gatherings generally took place at Erfurt, Eisenach, and sometimes at Arnstadt.  Even after the family had grown very large, and many of its members had left Thuringia to settle in Upper and Lower Saxony and Franconia, the Bachs continued their annual meetings.  On these occasions music was their sole recreation.  As those present were either Cantors, Organists, or Town Musicians, employed in the service of the Church and accustomed to preface the day's work with prayer, their first act was to sing a Hymn.  Having fulfilled their religious duty, they spent the rest of the time in frivolous recreations.  Best of all they liked to extemporise a chorus out of popular songs, comic or jocular, weaving them into a harmonious whole while declaiming the words of each. They called this hotch-potch a  laughed uproariously at it, and roused equally hearty and irrepressible laughter in their audience. It is suggested that German Comic Opera has its origin in these trifles.  But the  was a familiar institution in Germany at a much earlier period.  I possess a collection of them printed and published at Vienna in 1542.\",\n",
       " 'But these light-hearted Thuringians, and even those of their family who treated their art more seriously and worthily, would not have escaped oblivion had there not emerged in the fulness of time one whose genius and renown reflected their splendour and brilliancy on his forbears.  This man, the glory of his family, pride of his countrymen, most gifted favourite of the Muse of Music, was Johann Sebastian Bach.',\n",
       " 'Johann Sebastian Bach was born on March 21, 1685, at Eisenach, where his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was Court and Town Musician. Johann Ambrosius had a twin brother, Johann Christoph, Musician to the Court and Town of Arnstadt, who so exactly resembled him that even their wives could distinguish them only by their dress.  The twins appear to have been quite remarkable.  They were deeply attached, alike in disposition, in voice, and in the style of their music.  If one was ill, so was the other.  They died within a short time of each other, and were objects of wondering interest to all who knew them.',\n",
       " \"In 1695, when Johann Sebastian was not quite ten years old, his father died. He lost his mother at an earlier period. So, being left an orphan,he became dependent on his eldest brother, Johann Christoph, Organist at Ohrdruf, from whom he received his earliest lessons on the Clavier. His inclination and talent for music must already have been pronounced.  For his brother no sooner had given him one piece to learn than the boy was demanding another more difficult.  The most renowned Clavier composers of that day were Froberger, Fischer, Johann Caspar Kerl, Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Bruhns, and Böhm. Johann Christoph possessed a book containing several pieces by these masters, and Bach begged earnestly for it, but without effect.  Refusal increasing his determination, he laid his plans to get the book without his brother's knowledge.  It was kept on a book-shelf which had a latticed front.  Bach's hands were small.  Inserting them, he got hold of the book, rolled it up, and drew it out.  As he was not allowed a candle, he could only copy it on moonlight nights, and it was six months before he finished his heavy task.  As soon as it was completed he looked forward to using in secret a treasure won by so much labour.  But his brother found the copy and took it from him without pity, nor did Bach recover it until his brother's death soon after.\",\n",
       " \"Being once more left destitute, Johann Sebastian set out for Lüneburg with one of his Ohrdruf schoolfellows, named Erdmann (afterwards Russian Resident at Danzig), and entered the choir of St. Michael's Convent.  His fine treble voice procured him a fair livelihood. But unfortunately he soon lost it and did not at once develop another.\",\n",
       " \"Meanwhile his ambition to play the Organ and Clavier remained as keen as ever, and impelled him to hear and practise everything that promised him improvement.  For that purpose, while he was at Lüeburg, he several times travelled to Hamburg to hear the famous organist, JohannAdam Reinken. Often, too, he walked to Celle to hear the Duke's French band play French music, which was a novelty in those parts.\",\n",
       " \"The date and circumstances of his removal from Lüneburg to Weimar are not precisely known. He certainly became Court Musician there in 1703, when he was just over eighteen years of age. But in the following year he gave up the post on his appointment as Organist to the new Church at Arnstadt, probably desiring to develop his taste for the Organ and realising that he would have better opportunities to do so at Arnstadt than at Weimar, where he was engaged simply to play the Violin. At Arnstadt he set himself assiduously to study the works of the celebrated organists of the period, so far as his modest means permitted him, and in order to improve himself in composition and Organ playing, walked the whole way to Lübeck to hear Dietrich Buxtehude, Organist of St. Mary's Church in that city, with whose compositions he was acquainted already. He remained there about three months, listeningto the celebrated Organist, but without making himself known to him, and returned to Arnstadt with his experience much increased.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's zeal and persevering diligence had already drawn attention to him, as is evident from the fact that he received in succession several offers of vacant organistships, one of which, at the Church of St. Blasius, Mühlhausen, he accepted in 1707. Barely a year after he entered upon his duties there he again visited Weimar and played to the Duke, who was so pleased with his performance that he offered him the post of Court Organist, which he accepted. Weimar promisedhim a particularly agreeable atmosphere in which to cultivate his genius. He applied himself closely to his work, and probably at this period achieved the mastery of the Organ that he ever afterwards possessed.  At Weimar also he wrote his great compositions for that instrument. In 1717 the Duke appointed him Concertmeister, a post which gave him further opportunity to develop his art, since it required him to compose and direct Church music.\",\n",
       " \"It was about this time that Zachau, Handel's master, died at Halle, where he was Organist. Bach, who by now had acquired a great reputation, was invited to succeed him. He visited Halleand composed a work as a specimen of his skill But for some reason unknown he did not obtain the post.  It was given to a clever pupil of Zachau, named Kirchhoff.\",\n",
       " \"Johann Sebastian was now thirty-two years old. He had made good use of his opportunities, had studied hard as a player and composer, and by tireless enthusiasm had so completely mastered every branch of his art, that he towered like a giant above his contemporaries. Both amateurs and professional musicians already regarded him with admiration when, in 1717, Marchand, the French virtuoso, a celebrated Clavier andOrgan player, visited Dresden.  He played before the King-Elector and won such approbation that he was offered a large salary to enter His Majesty's service. Marchand's chief merit was his finished technique.  Like Couperin, his musical ideas were weak to the point of banality, as we may judge from his compositions. Bach was an equally finished player, and so rich in ideas that Marchand's head would have swollen had he been equally gifted.  Volumier, Concertmeister at Dresden, was aware of these circumstances, and knowing that the young German had his instrument and his imagination under the fullest control, determined to arrange a contest between the two men in order to give his sovereign the satisfaction of judging their merits.  With the King's approbation, a message was dispatchedto Bach at Weimar inviting him to a contest with Marchand.  Bach accepted the invitation and set out at once on his journey.  Upon his arrival at Dresden Volumier procured him an opportunity to hear Marchand secretly.  Far from being discouraged by what he heard, Bach wrote a polite note to the French artist challenging him to a trial of skill, and offering to play at sight anything Marchand put before him, provided the Frenchman submitted himself to a similar test.  Marchand accepted the challenge, a time and place for the contest were fixed, and the King gave his approval.  At the appointed hour a large and distinguished company assembled in the house of Marshal Count Flemming. Bach arrived punctually; Marchand did not appear.  After considerable delay he was sought at his lodging, when it was discovered, to the astonishment of all, that he had left Dresden that morning without taking leave of anybody.  Bach therefore performed alone, and excited the admiration of all who heard him, though Volumier was cheated of his intention to exhibit the inferiority of French to German art.  Bach was overwhelmed with congratulations; but the dishonesty of a Court official is said to haveintercepted a present of one hundred louis d'or sent to him by the King.\",\n",
       " \"Bach had not long returned to Weimar when Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen, a good judge of music and a first-rate amateur, offered him the post of Kapellmeister.  He entered at once upon his new office and held it for about six years. At this period, about 1722, he visitedHamburg, played the Organ there, and excited general admiration.  The veteran Reinken—he was nearly one hundred years old—was particularly impressed by Bach's performance.  After he had treated the Choral  for half an hour in variation after variation in the true Organ style, Reinken paid him the compliment of saying,   Reinken had treated the same Choral in a similar manner some years before and had had his work engraved, showing that he thought highly of it.  His praise therefore was particularly flattering to Bach.\",\n",
       " \"On the death of Kuhnau in 1723 Bach was appointed Director of Music and Cantor to St. Thomas' School, Leipzig, a position which heoccupied until his death.  Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen had great regard for him and Bach left his service with regret. But he saw the finger of Providence in the event; for the Prince died shortly afterwards. The loss of his patron affected him deeply, and moved him to compose a funeral Cantata containing remarkably fine double choruses which he himself conducted at Cöthen. While he was at St. Thomas' he was appointed honorary Kapellmeister to the Duke of Weissenfels and, in the following year(1736), received the title of Court Composer to the King-Elector of Poland-Saxony. The two compliments are not of great consequence, and the second was to some degree corollary to Bach's position as Cantor of St. Thomas' School.\",\n",
       " \"Carl Philipp Emmanuel, Bach's second son, entered the service of Frederick the Great of Prussia in 1740.  So widely was Bach's skill recognised by this time that the King, who often heard him praised, was curious to meet so great an artist.  More than once he hinted to Carl Philipp Emmanuel that it would be agreeable to welcome his father to Potsdam, and as Bach did not appear, desired to know the reason.  Carl Philipp did not fail to acquaint his father with the King's interest.  But for some time Bach was too occupied with his duties to accede to the invitation.  However, as Carl Philipp continued to urge him, he set out for Potsdam towards the end of 1747, in company with his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann. It was the King's custom to hold a private concert every evening, and to take part on the flute in a Concerto or two. One evening, when he had got out his flute and the musicians were at their desks, an official brought him a list of the strangers newly arrived at Potsdam.  Flute in hand the King ran through the names, and suddenly turning to the waiting musicians, said with considerable excitement,   The flute was put away for the evening, and Bach, who had alighted at his son's lodging, was summoned immediately to the Palace.  Wilhelm Friedemann, who accompanied his father, often told me the story.  Nor am I likely to forget the racy manner in which he related it.  The courtesy of those days demanded rather prolix compliments, and the first introduction of Bach to so illustrious a monarch, into whose presence he had hurried without being allowed time to change his travelling dress for a Cantor's black gown, obviously invited ceremonial speeches on both sides.  I will not dwell on them; Wilhelm Friedemann relateda lengthy and formal conversation between the King and the Cantor.\",\n",
       " \"More worthy of record is the fact that the King gave up his concert for that evening and invited Bach, already known as  to try the Silbermann pianofortes which stood in various parts of the Palace. Accompanied from room to room by the King and the musicians, Bach tried the instruments and improvised upon them before his illustrious companion.  After some time he asked the King to give him a subject for a Fugue, that he might treat it extempore.  The King did so, and expressed his astonishment at Bach's profound skill in developing it.  Anxious to see to what lengths the art could be carried, the King desired Bach to improvise a six-part Fugue.  But as every subject is not suitable for polyphonictreatment, Bach himself chose a theme and, to the astonishment of all who were present, developed it with the skill and distinction he had shown in treating the King's subject.  His Majesty expressed a wish to hear him on the Organ also. Accordingly, next day, Bach inspected all the Organs in Potsdam, as the evening before he had tried the Silbermann pianofortes. On his return to Leipzig he developed the King's theme in three and six parts, added  upon it, engraved the whole under the title  and dedicated it to the royal author of the theme.\",\n",
       " \" His visit to Potsdam was Bach's last journey.  The indefatigable diligence he had shown all his life, and particularly in his younger years, when successive days and nights were given to study, seriously affected his eye-sight.  The weakness grew with age and became very distressing in character.  On the advice of friends who placed great confidence in the skill of a London oculist lately come to Leipzig, Bach submitted to anoperation, which twice failed.  He lost his sight completely in consequence, and his hitherto vigorous constitution was undermined by the drugs administered to him.  He sank gradually for full half a year, and expired on the evening of July 30, 1760, in the sixty-sixth year of his age. Ten days before his death he was suddenly able to see again and to bear the light.  A few hours later he was seized by an apoplexy and inflammatory fever, and notwithstanding all possible medical aid, his weakened frame succumbed to the attack.\",\n",
       " 'Such was the career of this remarkable man.  I will only add that he was twice married, and that he had by his first wife seven, and by his second wife thirteen children; in all, eleven sons and nine daughters. All of his sons had anadmirable talent for music, but only the elder ones fully developed it.',\n",
       " \"Bach was inducted into his office as Cantor of St. Thomas' School at nine o'clock on the morning of Monday, May 31, 1723.  He died in his official residence there at a quarter to nine on the evening of Tuesday, July 28, 1750.  He was buried early on the morning of Friday, July 31, in the churchyard of St. John's, Leipzig.\",\n",
       " \"The announcement of his death, made from the pulpit of St. Thomas' on the day of his funeral, described him as   Bach usually designated himself  or shortly,   Circumstances led him to emphasise a title which asserted a musical prerogative not confined to the School and the churches it served.\",\n",
       " \"The Cantor of St. Thomas' was charged formerly with the musical direction of four Leipzig churches: St. Thomas', St. Nicolas', St. Peter's, and the New Church.  He was also responsible for the music in the University Church of St. Paul, the so-called  held originally on the Festivals of Easter, Whit, Christmas, and the Reformation, and once during each University quarter. On high days music also had to be provided at St. John's Church. \",\n",
       " \"Bach, as Cantor, succeeded to a more restricted responsibility, which dated from the early years of the eighteenth century.  The New Church, originally the Church of the Franciscans, had been restored to use in 1699.  In 1704 Georg Philipp Telemann, who came to Leipzig as a law student three years before, was appointed Organist there. He also founded the Collegium Musicum, or University Musical Society, a farther slight upon the Cantor's position.  Not until 1729 did the Society pass under Bach's direction and its members become available as auxiliaries in the church choirs under his charge.  Notwithstanding that Bach's predecessor Kuhnau had protested against Telemann's independence, the direction of the New Church's music passed out of the Cantor's control, though the School continued to provide the choristers.  Six years later the University Church of St. Paul also began an independent course.  In 1710 the authorities resolved to hold a University service in the church every Sunday. Kuhnau asserted his prerogative as Cantor. Buthe was only able to maintain it by offering to provide the music for the  as well as for the  at the fee of twelve thalers which the University so far had paid for the latter.  After his death the University appointed (April 3, 1723) Johann Gottlieb Görner, already Organist of St. Nicolas' since 1721, to control the music both of the  and  services, for which the University provided the choir.  Not until after a direct appeal to the King did Bach succeed, in 1726, in compelling the University to restore to the Cantor his emoluments in regard to the  the conduct of which had been restored to him on his appointment as Cantor.  The  remained under Görner's direction.  As to St. Peter's, its services, which had entirely ceased, were revived in 1711. The music, however, was simple, and consisted only of hymns.\",\n",
       " \"Thus Bach, as Cantor, was responsible for the music in the two principal churches, St. Thomas' and St. Nicolas'.  The School also provided the choir for St. Peter's and the New Church.  The junior and least competent singers sang at St. Peter's.  The rest were pretty equally distributed between the other three churches.  At the New Church the music was performed under the direction of a Chorpräfect.  At St. Thomas' and St. Nicolas' Bach personally directed the concerted music.  On ordinary Sundays a Cantata or Motetwas performed in each church alternately.  At the great Festivals, New Year, Epiphany, Ascension Day, Trinity Sunday, and the Annunciation, Cantatas were sung at both churches, the two choirs singing at Vespers in the second church the Cantata performed by them in the morning at the other church.  On these occasions the second choir was conducted by a Chorpräfect.  The principal Sunday service in both churches began at seven in the morning, ended at eleven, and observed the following order:\",\n",
       " 'Vespers began at a quarter past one and was a comparatively simple service; the music consisted of Hymns, a Motet, and the Magnificat. On the last three Sundays in Advent and throughout Lent neither Cantatas nor Motets were sung. The Organ was silent. On the three great Festivals the appointed Hymn for the season was sung at the beginning ofthe principal service, before the Organ Prelude: at Christmas, ; at Easter, ; at Whitsuntide,   During the Communion service the Sanctus and concerted music were sung.  A festal hymn followed the Benediction.  The three great Festivals were each observed for three consecutive days, on the first and second of which Cantatas were sung at both churches.  On the third day concerted music was sung at only one of the two churches.',\n",
       " \"The other week-day Festivals for which Cantatas were provided were the Feast of the Circumcision (New Year's Day), Epiphany, Ascension Day, Purification of the B.V.M., Annunciation of the B.V.M., Visitation of the B.V.M., Feast of St. John Baptist (Midsummer Day), Feast of St. Michael the Archangel. The Reformation Festival was kept on October 31, or if that date was a Saturday or Monday, on the previous or following Sunday.\",\n",
       " \"On Good Friday the Passion was performed in the two principal churches alternately.  Leipzig adopted no official Hymn-book.  The compilation from which the Hymns were chosen by Bach was the eight-volumed of Paul Wagner, published at Leipzig for Dresden use in 1697.  It contained over five thousand Hymns but no music, merely the name of the tune being stated above the Hymn.  For themost part the Hymns for special, and even for ordinary, occasions were prescribed by custom. Otherwise the power of selection was in the hands of the Cantor, and Bach's exercise of it caused some friction with the clergy in 1728.\",\n",
       " \"The provision and direction of the music at weddings and funerals was in the Cantor's hands.  He arranged the choirs and the music sung at the scholars' annual processions and perambulations of the town, which took place at Michaelmas, New Year, and on St. Martin's and St. Gregory's Days.\",\n",
       " \"Augmenting the School's choristers, the Town Musicians took part in the Church services and were under the Cantor's direction. Their numbers and efficiency were inadequate.\",\n",
       " 'Upon the staff of the School the Cantor ranked third after the Rector and Sub-Rector, and took a share in the general instruction of the scholars.  Class III. went to Bach for Latin lessons, a duty which the Council eventually permitted him to fulfil by deputy.  Singing classes were held by the Cantor on three days of the week, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, at nine and noon, and on Fridays at noon.  His instruction in singing was given to the four upper classes only.  On Saturday afternoons the Cantata was rehearsed.  Once in four weeks the Cantor took his turn to inspect the scholars.  Like the other masters, he was required to conform to the regulationsof the School House, in which he lived.  He rose at five in summer, at six in winter, dined at ten and supped at five in the afternoon.',\n",
       " \" Holidays were numerous.  A week's vacation was given at the Easter, Michaelmas, and New Year Fairs.  At Midsummer the School had a month of half-holidays.  Whole holidays were given on the birthdays of the four upper masters.  There were no morning lessons on Saints' Days, on the occasion of funeral orations in the University Church, and on the quarterly Speech Days.  Hence, though Bach's office carried large responsibility, it left him considerable leisure for composition.\",\n",
       " \"As Cantor Bach had an official residence in the left wing of the School House.  In 1723, the Cantor's wing was of two storeys only, dwarfed by the greater elevation of the main edifice and under the shadow of the church.  Bach brought to Leipzig four children of his first marriage, and his second wife, Anna Magdalena, presented him with a son or daughter annually from 1723 to 1729.  The accommodation of the Cantor's lodging therefore rapidly became inadequate.  In the spring of 1731 Bach found a house elsewhere while an additional storey was added to it, which provided a new music-room, a good-sized apartment whence a passage led to the big schoolroom in the main building.  The new wing was formally opened and dedicated on June 5, 1732, whenBach's secular Cantata  was performed; the libretto being by his colleague Winkler.  From thenceforward till his death eighteen years later Bach's occupancy was not disturbed.  The wing continued to be the official residence of the Cantor until the School moved to the suburbs of the city in 1877.\",\n",
       " \"In addition to his residence, which he occupied rent free, the Cantor enjoyed a revenue from various and fluctuating sources, amounting in gross to 700 thalers (=£106 per annum).  His fixed stipend was only 100 thalers (=£15).  About 12 thalers came to him from endowments.  In kind he was entitled to 16 bushels of corn and 2 cords of firelogs, together with 2 measures of wine at each of the three great Festivals.  From the University, after his successful protest, he received 12 thalers for directing the  By far the larger part of Bach's income was derived from fluctuating sources.  They were of three kinds: (1) School monies, (2) funeral fees, (3) wedding fees.  The School monies represented perquisites derived from funds obtained by the scholars, partly by their weekly collections from the public, partly from the four annual processions or perambulations of the city.  From the weekly collections a sum of six pfennigs multiplied by the number of the scholars was put aside for the four upper masters, among whom the Cantor ranked third.  From the money collected at theNew Year, Michaelmas, and St. Martin's Day processions the Rector took a thaler, the Cantor and the Sub-Rector each took one-eleventh of the balance, sixteen thirty-thirds went to the singers, and one-quarter of what remained fell to the Cantor.  Out of the money collected on St. Gregory's Day (March 12) the Rector took one-tenth for the entertainment of the four upper masters, and the Cantor took one-third of the residue.  For funerals one thaler 15 groschen was paid when the whole school accompanied the procession and a Motet was sung at the house of the deceased.  When no Motet was sung the Cantor's fee was 15 groschen. For weddings he received two thalers.\",\n",
       " \"Reckoned in modern currency, and judged by the standard of the period, the Cantor's income was not inadequate and served to maintain Bach's large family in comfort.  When he died in 1750, in addition to a mining share valued at 60 thalers, he possessed in cash or bonds about 360 thalers, silver plate valued at 251 thalers, instruments valued at 371 thalers, house furniture valued at 29 thalers, and books valued at 38 thalers.  His whole estate was declared at 1158 thalers, or somewhat less than the savings of two years' income.  But for the inequitable distribution of his property, owing to his intestacy, which left Anna Magdalena only about 400 thalers and the mining share, Bach's widow and unmarrieddaughters ought not to have been afflicted with excessive poverty, as in fact they were.\",\n",
       " \"At the beginning of his Cantorate Bach worked amid discouraging and unsatisfactory conditions.  The Rector, Johann Heinrich Ernesti, was over seventy years of age in 1723.  The School was badly managed, its discipline was relaxed, the better-to-do citizens withheld their sons from it, and its numbers were seriously diminished.  In 1717 the junior classes contained only 53 as against 120 in Ernesti's earlier years.  The proximity and operatic traditions of Dresden and Weissenfels also had a bad effect; the St. Thomas' boys, after attaining musical proficiency, were apt to become restless, demanding release from their indentures, and even running away to more attractive and lucrative occupations.  Moreover, the governors of the School were the Town Council, a body which had little sympathy with or appreciation of Bach's artistic aims and temperament.  To these difficulties must be added another.  The Town Musicians, on whom Bach relied for the nucleus of his orchestra, were few in number and inefficient.\",\n",
       " \"So long as Ernesti lived, there was little prospect of reform.  But, after his death, in October 1729, Bach made vigorous representations to the Town Council.  Already he had remonstrated with the Council for presenting to foundation scholarships boys who lacked musical aptitude.  The Councilretaliated by accusing Bach of neglecting his singing classes, absenting himself without leave, and of other irregularities.  He was declared to be  and it was resolved (August 2, 1730) to sequestrate the Cantor's income, in other words, to withhold from him the perquisites to which he was entitled for the conduct of the Church services.\",\n",
       " 'Bach was not deterred from offering, three weeks later (August 23, 1730), a  in Leipzig.  The document reveals the conditions amid which Bach worked.  Its representations may be summarised:',\n",
       " \"The foundation scholars of St. Thomas' are of four classes: Trebles, Altos, Tenors, Basses. \",\n",
       " 'A choir needs from four to eight  (solo singers) and at least two  to each chorus part,  a minimum of twelve voices.',\n",
       " \"The foundation scholars number fifty-five, by whom the choirs of the four Churches, St. Thomas', St. Nicolas', St. Peter's, and the New Church are provided.  For the instrumental accompaniments at least twenty players are required: viz., 2 or 3 first Violins, 2 or 3 second Violins, 4 Violas, 2 Violoncelli, 1 Contrabasso, 2 or more Flutes, 2 or 3 Oboi,1 or 2 Fagotti, 3 Trombe, 1 Timpani.  To fill these places there are eight Town Musicians, and at the moment there are no players available for third Tromba, Timpani, Viola, Violoncello, Contrabasso, third Oboe (or Taille).\",\n",
       " 'To augment the Town Musicians the Cantor has been wont in the past to employ University students and instrumental players in the School.  Upon the former  he relies for Viola, Violoncello, and Contrabasso, and  for the second Violins.  But the Council, by its recent resolution, no longer affords the Cantor the means to employ them.  To place the scholars in the orchestra weakens the choir, to which they naturally belong.',\n",
       " \"By presenting to foundation scholarships boys unskilled and ignorant of music, the resources at the Cantor's disposal are still farther lessened.\",\n",
       " ' Hence, Bach concludes, ',\n",
       " \" No answer was made to Bach's memorial, and he contemplated resigning his position.  But with the advent of Johann Matthias Gesner as Rector in September 1730 a happier period dawned upon the  Cantor.  In 1732 Gesner procured the withdrawal of the Council's ban on Bach's perquisites.  The fallen fortunes of the School revived, and Bach did not again make an effort to leave Leipzig.  In 1736 the grant of thepost of Hof-Componist to the Saxon Court gave him at length a title which compelled the deference of his civic masters.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's early misunderstanding with the University cut him off from association with the most dignified, if not the most important, institution in Leipzig, and deprived him of opportunity to display his genius beyond the radius of his Church duties.  The situation changed in 1729, when he became director of the University Society, and he held the post for about ten years.  The Society gave weekly concerts on Fridays, from 8 to 10, and an extra concert, during the Fair season, on Thursdays at the same hour.  It performed vocal and instrumental music and was the medium through which Bach presented his secular Cantatas, Clavier and Violin Concertos, and Orchestral Suites to the public.  The proficiency of his elder sons and pupils, and his wife's talent as a singer, were a farther source of strength to the Society, whose direction undoubtedly made these years the happiest in Bach's life.  He took his rightful place in the musical life of the city, and relegated to a position of inferiority the smaller fry, such as Görner, who had presumed on Bach's aloofness from the University and Municipality to insinuate themselves.  His increasing reputation as an organist, gained in his annual autumn tours, also enlightened his fellow-townsmen regarding the superlative worth of one whom at the outsetthey were disposed to treat as a subordinate official.\",\n",
       " \"The Leipzig of Bach's day offered various opportunities for musical celebration; official events in the University,  or  of favourite professors by their students, as well as patriotic occasions in which town and gown participated.  The recognised fee for  of a public character was fifty thalers.  Bach's conductorship of the University Society enabled him to perform festival works with the resources they required, and to augment the band and chorus needed for their adequate performance.\",\n",
       " \"Even before he undertook the direction of the University Society, Bach more than once provided the music for University celebrations.  On August 3, 1725, his secular Cantata,  was performed at the students' celebration of Doctor August Friedrich Müller's name-day.  In 1726 he revived an old Cantatato celebrate the birthday of another of the Leipzig teachers.  In the same year the appointment of Dr. Gottlieb Kortte as Professor of Roman Law was celebrated by Bach's Cantata  In 1733 the birthday of another Professor was marked by the performance of the Cöthen Cantata to yet another text (). On November 21, 1734, the lost Cantata  was sung at the induction of Gesner's successor, Johann August Ernesti, as Rector of St. Thomas' School.\",\n",
       " \"But Bach's activity as a secular composer at Leipzig was chiefly expended on patriotic celebrations.  His compositions of this character are particularly numerous during the years 1733-36, while he was seeking from the Dresden Court the post of Hof-Componist.  The first of these celebrations took place on May 12, 1727, the birthday of Augustus II. of Poland-Saxony, when Bach's Cantata,  was performed in the Market Place by the University Society.  The King was present and listened to the performance from a convenient window.  The music is lost.  Six years elapsed before Bach was invited to collaborate in another celebration of the royal House.  On September 5, 1733, less than two months after his application for the post of Hof-Componist, the University Society celebrated the eleventh birthday of the Electoral Prince by performing Bach's ,  or   Barely three months later, on December 8, 1733, Bach produced another Cantata in honour of the royal family,  of which he was both author and composer.  On no less than three occasions in 1734 Bach didhomage to his unheeding sovereign.  In January the University Society, under Bach's direction, performed his Cantata  to celebrate the coronation of Augustus III.  The music had already done duty in Dr. Müller's honour in 1725.  On the following October 5, 1734, when the King visited Leipzig, Bach's hurriedly written Cantata,  whose first chorus became the  of the B minor Mass, was performed in the Market Place.  Two days later, on October 7, 1734, the King's birthday was celebrated by another Bach Cantata,  performed by the Collegium Musicum.  In 1738, having received the coveted title of Hof-Componist in the interval (1736), Bach performed a work——now lost, in honour of the marriage of the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony to Charles of Sicily, afterwards Charles III. of Spain.\",\n",
       " \"Apart from his musical activities and the house in which he lived there is little that permits us to picture Bach's life at Leipzig.  Association with his friends Johann Christian Hoffmann, Musical Instrument Maker to the Court, Marianne von Ziegler, J. C. Gottsched and his musical wife, Johann Abraham Birnbaum, among the Professoriate, Picander and Christian Weiss, Bach's regular librettists, suggests the amenities of an academic and literary circle. But the claims ofhis art and the care of his large family had the first call upon Bach's interest.  And few men had a happier home life.  While his elder sons were at home the family concerts were among his most agreeable experiences.  As his fame increased, his house became the resort of many seeking to know and hear the famous organist.  Late in the thirties he resigned his directorship of the University Society.  His sons were already off his hands and out of his house, and he turned again to the Organ works of his Weimar period.  Their revision occupied the last decade of his life, and the hitherto constant flow of Church Cantatas ceased.  Pupils resorted to him and filled his empty house, to one of whom, Altnikol, he gave a daughter in marriage.\",\n",
       " 'A man of rigid uprightness, sincerely religious; steeped in his art, earnest and grave, yet not lacking naive humour; ever hospitable and generous, and yet shrewd and cautious; pugnacious when his art was slighted or his rights were infringed; generous in the extreme to his wife and children, and eager to give the latter advantages which he had never known himself; a lover of sound theology, and of a piety as deep as it was unpretentious—such were the qualities of one who towers above all other masters of music in moral grandeur.',\n",
       " \"Four, perhaps only three, contemporary portraits of Bach are known.  One is in thepossession of the firm of Peters at Leipzig and once belonged to Carl Philipp Emmanuel's daughter, who with inherited impiety sold it to a Leipzig flute player.  The second hung in St. Thomas' School and is reproduced at p. 48 of this volume.  It was painted in 1746 and restored in 1913.  Both portraits are by Elias Gottlieb Haussmann, Court Painter at Dresden.  The third portrait belonged to Bach's last pupil, Kittel, and used to hang on the Organ at Erfurt, whence it disappeared after 1809, during the Napoleonic wars.  Recently Professor Fritz Volbach of Mainz has discovered a fourth portrait, which is printed at p. 92 of the present volume.  He supposes it to be none other than the Erfurt portrait, as indeed it well may be, since it represents a man of some sixty years, austere in countenance, but of a dignity that is not so apparent in Haussmann's portraiture.\",\n",
       " \"Bach left no will.  In consequence his widow, Anna Magdalena, burdened with the charge of a step-daughter and two daughters, was entitled to only one-third of her husband's estate.  NeitherCarl Philipp Emmanuel nor Wilhelm Friedemann was her own child.  But the fact cannot excuse gross neglect of their father's widow.  Her own sons were in a position to make such a contribution to her income as would at least have kept want from her door.  In fact she was permitted to become dependent on public charity, and died, an alms-woman, on February 27, 1760, nearly ten years after her great husband.  The three daughters survived her.  One died in 1774, the second in 1781.  The third, Regine Susanna, survived them, her want relieved by gifts from a public that at last was awakening to the grandeur of her father.  Beethoven contributed generously.  Regine Susanna died in December 1809, the last of Bach's children.  In 1845 her nephew, Johann Christoph Friedrich's son, also died.  With him the line of Johann Sebastian Bach expired.\",\n",
       " \"As a Clavier player Bach was admired by all who had the good fortune to hear him and was the envy of the virtuosi of his day.  His method greatly differed from that of his contemporaries and predecessors, but so far no one has attempted to explain in what the difference consisted.  The same piece of music played by ten different performers equally intelligent and competent will produce a different effect in each case.  Each player will emphasise this or that detail.  This or that note will stand out with differing emphasis, and the general effect will vary consequently.  And yet, if all the players are equally competent, ought not their performances to be uniform?  The fact that they are not so is due to difference of touch, a quality which to the Clavier stands as enunciation to human speech.  Distinctness is essential for the enunciation of vowels and consonants, and not less so for the articulation of a musical phrase.  But there are gradations of distinctness.  If a sound is emitted indistinctly it is comprehensible onlywith effort, which occasions us to lose much of the pleasure we should otherwise experience.  On the other hand, over-emphasis of words or notes is to be avoided.  Otherwise the hearer's attention will be diverted from the .  To permit the general effect to be appreciated every note and every vowel must be sounded with balanced distinctness.\",\n",
       " \"I have often wondered why Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach's does not elucidate the qualities that constitute a good touch.  For he possessed in high degree the technique that made his father pre-eminent as a player.  True, in his chapter on  he writes, But it would have been more useful had he told us how to reach this middle path.  As he has not done so, I must try to make the matter as clear as is possible in words.\",\n",
       " \"Bach placed his hand on the finger-board so that his fingers were bent and their extremities poised perpendicularly over the keys in a planeparallel to them.Consequently none of his fingers was remote from the note it was intended to strike, and was ready instantly to execute every command.  Observe the consequences of this position.  First of all, the fingers cannot  or (as so often happens) be  upon the notes, but are  upon them in full control of the force they may be called on to exert.  In the second place, since the force communicated to the note needs to be maintained with uniform pressure, the finger should not be released perpendicularly from the key, but can be withdrawn gently and gradually towards the palm of the hand.  In the third place, when passing from one note to another, a sliding action instinctively instructs the next finger regarding the amount of force exerted by its predecessor, so that the tone is equally regulated and the notes are equally distinct.  In other words, the touch is neither too long nor too short, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel complains, but is just what it ought to be.Many advantages arise from holding the hand in Bach's position and from adopting his touch,on the Clavichord and Harpsichord,and on  the Organ as well.  I point out merely the most important of them.   To begin with, if the fingers are bent, their movements are free.  The notes are struck without effort and with less risk of missing or hitting too hard, a frequent fault with people who play with their fingers elongated or insufficiently bent.  In the second place, the sliding finger-tip, and the consequently rapid transmission of regulated force from one finger to another, tend to bring out each note clearly and to make every passage sound uniformly brilliant and distinct to the hearer without exertion.  In the third place, stroking the note with uniform pressure permits the string to vibrate freely, improves and prolongs the tone, and though the Clavichord is poor in quality, allows the player to sustain long notes upon it.  And the method has this advantage: it prevents over-expenditure of strength and excessive movement of the hand.  We gather that the action of Bach's fingers was so slight as to be barely perceptible.  Only the top joint seemed to move.  His hand preserved its rounded shape even in the most intricate passages.  His fingers rested closely upon the keys, very much in the position required for a   An unemployed finger remained in aposition of repose.  It is hardly necessary to say thatthat other limbs of his body took no part in his performance, as is the case with many whose hands lack the requisite agility.\",\n",
       " 'A man may possess all these qualities, however, and remain an indifferent performer on the Clavier, just as clear and agreeable enunciation does not necessarily make a good speaker.  To be a first-rate performer many other qualities are needed, and Bach possessed them all in a notable degree.',\n",
       " 'Some fingers are longer and stronger than others. Hence players are frequently seduced to use the stronger whenever they can readily do so.  Consequently successive notes become unequal in tone, and passages which leave no choice as to the finger to be used may become impossible to play.  Bach recognised this fact very early in his career.  To get over the difficulty he invented exercises for his own use in which the fingers of both hands were made to practise passages in every conceivable position.  By this means every finger on both hands equally became strong and serviceable, so that he could play a rapid succession of chords, single and double  and running passages with the utmost finish and delicacy, and was equally fluent in passages where some fingers play a  while the others on the same hand continue the melody.',\n",
       " \"Besides these improvements, Bach invented a new system of fingering. Before his time, and even in his early years, it was usual for the player to pay attention to harmony rather than counterpoint. Even so it was not customary to use every one of the twenty-four major and minor keys.  The Clavichord was still what we term; that is, several keys struck the same string, which, therefore, could not be accurately tuned. Consequently it was usual to employ only those keys whose notes were tuned with some approximation to accuracy.  Again,good players in those days hardly ever used the thumb, except when a large interval had to be stretched.  But when Bach began to melodise harmony so that his middle parts not merely filled in but had a tune of their own, when, too, he began to deviate from the Church modes then in general vogue in secular music, using the diatonic and chromatic scales indifferently, and tuning the Clavier in all the twenty-four keys, he found himself compelled to introduce a system of fingering better adapted to his innovations than that in use, and in particular, to challenge the convention which condemned the thumb to inactivity. It is held by some writers that Couperin forestalled Bach's method of fingering, in his published in 1716.  But that is not the case.  In the first place, Bach was above thirty years old in 1716, and had already developed a distinctive method of his own.  And in the second place, Couperin's system differs materially from Bach's, though both made more frequent use of the thumb than was so far customary.  When I say  I do so advisedly; for whereas in Bach's system the thumb is the principal finger—for the difficult keys, as they are called, are unplayable without it—it is not equally indispensable with Couperin, whose thematic material was not so intricate as Bach's, nor did he compose or play in such difficult keys.  Consequently Couperinhad not an equally urgent need to use the thumb.  We need only compare Couperin's with Bach's system of fingering, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel explains it, to discover that Bach's permits every passage, however intricate and polyphonic, to be played with ease, whereas Couperin's is hardly effective even for his own compositions.  Bach was acquainted with Couperin's works and highly esteemed them, as he did those of other French Clavier composers, for their finish and brilliance.  But he considered them affected in their excessive use of ornaments, scarcely a single note being free from them.  He held them, also, superficial in matter.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's easy, unconstrained use of the fingers, his musical touch, the clearness and precision of every note he struck, the resourcefulness of his fingering, his thorough training of every finger of both hands, the luxuriance of his thematic material and his original method of stating it, all contributed to give him almost unlimited power over his instrument, so easily did he surmount the difficulties of its keyboard.  Whether he improvised or played his compositions from notes, he systematically employed every finger of each hand, and his fingering was as uncommon as the compositions themselves, yet so accurate that he never missed a note.  Moreover, he read at sight other people's compositions (which, to be sure, were much easier than his own) with the utmost facility.  Indeed, he once boasted to a friend at Weimar that he could play at sight and without a mistake anything put before him.  But he was mistaken, as his friend convinced him before the week was out.  Having invited Bach to breakfast one morning, he placed on the Clavier, among other music, a piece which, at a first glance, seemed perfectly easy.  On his arrival, Bach, as was his custom, sat down at the Clavier to play or look through the music.  Meanwhile his friend was in the next room preparing breakfast.  In a short time Bach took up the piece of music destined to change his opinion and began to play it.  He had not proceeded far before he came to a passage at which he stopped.  After a look at it he began again, only to stop at the same place.  he called out to his friend, who was laughing heartily in the next room, With that he got up from the Clavier in some annoyance.\",\n",
       " 'Bach also could read scores with remarkable facility and play them on the Clavier. He found no more difficulty in piecing together theseparate parts when laid side by side before him.He often did so when a friend brought him a new Trio or Quartet for Strings and wished to hear how it sounded.  If a Continuo part, however badly figured, was put before him he could improvise a Trio or Quartet upon it.  Nay, when he was in the mood and at the height of his powers, he would convert a Trio into a Quartet by extemporising a fourth part.  On such occasions he used a Harpsichord with two manuals and pedal attachment.',\n",
       " 'Bach preferred the Clavichord to the Harpsichord, which, though susceptible of great variety of tone, seemed to him lacking in soul.  The Pianoforte was still in its infancy and too coarse.Both for practice and intimate use he regarded the Clavichord as the best instrument and preferred to express on it his finest thoughts.  He held the Harpsichord, or Clavicembalo, incapable of the gradations of tone obtainable on the Clavichord, an instrument which, though feeble in quality, is extremely flexible.',\n",
       " \"No one could adjust the quill plectrums of his Harpsichord to Bach's satisfaction; he always did it himself.  He tuned his Harpsichord and Clavichord, and was so skilful in the operation that it never took him more than a quarter of an hour.  It enabled him to play in any key he preferred, and placed the whole twenty-four of them at his disposal, so that he could modulate into the remoter as easily and naturally as into the more nearly related keys.  Those who heard him frequently could hardly detect the fact that he had modulated into a distant key, so smooth were his transitions.  In chromatic movements his modulation was as easy and sequent as in diatonic.  His  which is now published, bears out my statement.  In his extemporisation he was even freer, more brilliant and expressive. \",\n",
       " 'When he played his own music Bach usually adopted a brisk pace.  He contrived to introduce so much variety that every piece became a sort of conversation between its parts.  If he wished to express deep emotion he did not strike the notes with great force, as many do, but expressed his feeling in simple melodic and harmonic figures,relying rather on the internal resources of his art than external dynamics.  Therein he was right.  True emotion is not suggested by hammering the Clavier. All that results is that the notes cannot be heard distinctly, much less be connected coherently. ',\n",
       " \"What has been said regarding Bach's admirable Clavier playing applies generally to his skill as an organist.  The Clavier and Organ have points in common, but in style and touch are as different as their respective uses.  What sounds well on the Clavier is ineffective on the Organ, and vice versa.  The most accomplished Clavier player may be, and usually is, a bad organist unless he realises the differing natures of the two instruments and the uses they serve.  I have come across only two men who can be regarded as exceptions to this general rule—Bach and his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann.  Both were finished Clavier performers, but no trace of the Clavier style was apparent when they played the Organ.  Melody, harmony, and pace were carefully selected with due regard to the nature and distinctive use of each instrument.  When Wilhelm Friedemann played the Clavier his touch was elegant, delicate, agreeable.  When he played the Organ he inspired a feeling of reverent awe. On the one he wascharming.  On the other he was solemn, impressive.  So also was his father, and to an even greater degree.  Wilhelm Friedemann was a mere child to him as an organist, and frankly admitted the fact. The music that extraordinary man wrote for the Organ is full of dignity, awe-inspiring, saturated with the atmosphere of devotion.  His improvisation was even more inspired, dignified, and impressive: for then his imagination was untrammelled by the irksomeness of expressing himself on paper.  What is the essence of this art? Let me, though imperfectly, attempt an answer.\",\n",
       " \"When we compare Bach's Clavier compositions with those written for the Organ it is at once apparent that they differ essentially in melodic and harmonic structure.  Hence we conclude that a good organist must select fitting themes for his instrument, and let himself be guided by its character and that of the place in which it stands and by the objects of its use.  Its great body of tone renders the Organ ill-adapted to light and jaunty music.  Its echoes must have liberty to rise and fall in the dim spaces of the church, otherwise the sound becomes confused, blurred, and unintelligible.  What is played upon itmust be suited to the place and the instrument, in other words, must be congruous to a solemn and majestic fabric.  Occasionally and exceptionally a solo stop may be used in a Trio, etc.  But the proper function of the Organ is to support church singing and to stimulate devotional feeling.  The composer therefore must not write music for it which is congruous to secular surroundings.  What is commonplace and trite can neither impress the hearer nor excite devotional feeling.  It must therefore be banished from the Organ-loft. How clearly Bach grasped that fact!  Even his secular music disdained trivialities.  Much more so his Organ music, in which he seems to soar as a spirit above this mortal planet.\",\n",
       " \"Of the means by which Bach attained to such an altitude as a composer for the Organ we may notice his harmonic treatment of the old Church modes, his use of the obbligato pedal, and his original registration.  The remoteness of the ecclesiastical modes from our twenty-four major and minor keys renders them particularly appropriate to the service of religion.  Any one who looks at Bach's simple four-part Hymn tunes () will at once convince himself of the fact.  But no one can realise how the Organ sounds under a similar system of harmonic treatment unless he has heard it.  It becomes a choir of four or five parts, each in its naturalcompass.  Compare the following chords in divided harmony:\",\n",
       " 'with these:',\n",
       " 'which is the more usual form organists employ.  We realise instantly the effect when music in four or more parts is played in the same manner.  Bach always played the Organ so, adding the obbligato pedal, which few organists know how to use properly.  He employed it not only to sound the low notes which organists usually play with the left hand, but he gave it a regular part of its own, often so complicated that many organists would find it difficult to play with their five fingers.',\n",
       " 'To these qualities must be added the exquisite art Bach displayed in combining the stops of the Organ.  His registration frequently astonished organists and Organ builders, who ridiculed it at first, but were obliged in the end to admit itsadmirable results and to confess that the Organ gained in richness and sonority.',\n",
       " \"Bach's peculiar registration was based on his intimate knowledge of Organ building and of the properties of each individual stop.  Very early in his career he made a point of giving to each part of the Organ the utterance best suited to its qualities, and this led him to seek unusual combinations of stops which otherwise would not have occurred to him.  Nothing escaped his notice which had the slightest bearing on his art or promised to advance it.  For instance, he made a point of observing the effect of large musical compositions in different surroundings.  The practised ear, which enabled him to detect the slightest error in music even of the fullest and richest texture, and the art and rapidity with which he tuned his instrument, alike attest his intuitive skill and many-sidedness.  When he was at Berlin in 1747 he was shown the new Opera House.  He took in its good and bad qualities at a glance, whereas others had done so only after experience.  He was shown the large adjoining Saloon and went up into the gallery that runs round it.  Merely glancing at the roof he remarked,   The Saloon, in fact, is a parallelogram. If a person puts his face to the wall in one corner of it and whispers a few words, another person at the corner diagonally opposite can hear them distinctly, though to others between them the words are inaudible.  The effect arises from the span of the arches in the roof, as Bach saw at a glance.  These and similar observations suggested to him striking and unusual combinations of Organ stops.\",\n",
       " ' Bach brought the methods I have indicated to bear upon Church music, and they help to explain his extraordinarily dignified and inspired playing, which was at once so appropriate and filled the listener with deep awe and admiration.  His profound knowledge of harmony, unfailing originality, freedom from a secular style, his complete command of the instrument, both manuals and pedals, whence flowed a generous stream of the richest and most abundant fancy, the infallible and swift judgment which allowed him always to select from the treasury of his mind precisely the musical ideas best suited to the occasion immediately before him, his intuitive grasp of every detail, and his power to make it serve his artistic ends—in a word, his transcendent genius brought the art of Organ playing to a degree of perfection which, till then, it had never attained and hardly will attain again.  Quantzhas expressed the same opinion.  he writes, ',\n",
       " 'Strangers often asked Bach to play to them between the hours of divine service.  On those occasions he was wont to select and treat a theme in various ways, making it the subject of each extemporisation even if he continued playing for two hours.  As a beginning he played a Prelude and Fugue on the Great Organ.  Then he developed it with solo stops in a Trio or Quartet.  A Hymn-tune followed, whose melody he interrupted in the subtlest fashion with fragments of the theme in three or four parts.  Last came a Fugue, with full Organ, in which he treated the subject alone or in association with one or more accessory themes.  Here we have the art which old Reinken of Hamburg considered to be lost, but which, as he afterwards found, not only survived but attained its greatest perfection in Bach.',\n",
       " \"Bach's pre-eminent position and his high reputation often caused him to be invited to examine candidates for vacant organistships, and to report on new Organs.  In both cases he acted so conscientiously and impartially that he generally made enemies.  Scheibe, late Director of Music at the Danish Court, who as a young man was examined by Bach on such an occasion, was so incensed by Bach's unfavourable verdict that he afterwards avenged himself in his  by violently attacking his examiner. In his examination of Organs Bach equally exposed himself to trouble.  He could as little prevail on himself to praise a bad instrument as to recommend a bad organist.  He was, therefore, severe, though always fair, in the tests he applied, and as he was thoroughly acquainted with the construction of the instrument it was hopeless to attempt to deceive him.  First of all he drew out all the stops, to hear the Full Organ.  He used to say jokingly, that he wanted to find out whether the instrument had good lungs!  Then he gave every part of it a most searching test.  But his sense of fairness was so strong that, if he found the work really well done, and the builder's remunerationtoo small, so that he was likely to be a loser, Bach endeavoured, and often successfully, to procure for him an adequate addition to the purchase price.\",\n",
       " 'When the examination was over, especially if the instrument pleased him, Bach liked to exhibit his splendid talent, both for his own pleasure and the gratification of those who were present.  Such demonstrations of his powers invariably invited the verdict, that he was conclusively  a title which Sorge, the late highly-esteemed organist at Lobenstein,once gave him in a dedicatory Preface.',\n",
       " \"Bach's first attempts at composition, like all early efforts, were unsatisfactory.  Lacking special instruction to direct him towards his goal, he was compelled to do what he could in his own way, like others who have set out upon a career without a guide.  Most youthful composers let their fingers run riot up and down the keyboard, snatching handfuls of notes, assaulting the instrument in wild frenzy, in hope that something may result from it.  Such people are merely Finger Composers—in his riper years Bach used to call them Harpsichord Knights—that is to say, their fingers tell them what to write instead of being instructed by the brain what to play. Bach abandoned that method of composition when he observed thatbrilliant flourishes lead nowhere.  He realised that musical ideas need to be subordinated to a plan and that the young composer's first need is a model to instruct his efforts.  Opportunely Vivaldi's Concertos for the Violin, then recently published, gave him the guidance he needed.  He had often heard them praised as admirable works of art, and conceived the happy idea of arranging them for the Clavier. Hence he was led to study their structure, the musical ideas on which they are built, the variety of their modulations, and other characteristics.  Moreover, in adapting to the Clavier ideas and phrases originally written for the Violin Bach was compelled to put his brain to work, and so freed his inspiration from dependence on his fingers.  Henceforth he was able to draw ideas out of his own storehouse, and having placed himself on the right road, needed only perseverance and hard work to succeed.  And how persevering he was!  He even robbedhimself of sleep to practise in the night what he had written during the day!  But the diligence he bestowed upon his own compositions did not hinder him from studying the works of Frescobaldi, Froberger, Kerl, Pachelbel, Fischer, Strungk, Buxtehude, Reinken, Bruhns, Böhm, and certain French organists who were famed in those days as masters of harmony and fugue.\",\n",
       " \"The models he selected—Church musicians for the most part—and his own disposition inclined him to serious and exalted subjects.  But in that kind of music little can be accomplished with inadequate technique.  Bach's first object, therefore, was to develop his power of expressing himself before he attempted to realise the ideal that beckoned him.  Music to him was a language, and the composer a poet who, whatever the idiom he affects, must first of all have at his disposal the means of making himself intelligible to others.  But the technique of his period Bach found limited in variety and insufficiently pliable.  Therefore he set himself at the outset to refashion the accepted harmonic system.  He did so in a manner characteristically individual and bearing the impress of his personality.\",\n",
       " 'If the language of music is merely the utterance of a melodic line, a simple sequence of musical notes, it can justly be accused of poverty.  The addition of a Bass puts it upon a harmonic foundation and clarifies it, but defines rather than gives it added richness.  A melody so accompanied—even though all the notes are not those of the true Bass—or treated with simple embellishments in the upper parts, or with simple chords, used to be called   But it is a very different thing when two melodies are so interwoven that they converse together like two persons upon a footing of pleasant equality.  In the first case the accompaniment is subordinate, and serves merely to support the first or principal part.  In the second case the two parts are not similarly related.  New melodic combinations spring from their interweaving, out of which new forms of musical expression emerge.  If more parts are interwoven in the same free and independent manner, the apparatus of language is correspondingly enlarged, and becomes practically inexhaustible if, in addition, varieties of form and rhythm are introduced.  Hence harmony becomes no longer a mere accompaniment of melody, but rather a potent agency for augmenting the richness and expressiveness of musical conversation.  To serve that end a simple accompaniment will not suffice.  True harmony is the interweaving of several melodies, whichemerge now in the upper, now in the middle, and now in the lower parts.',\n",
       " \"From about the year 1720, when he was thirty-five, until his death in 1750, Bach's harmony consists in this melodic interweaving of independent melodies, so perfect in their union that each part seems to constitute the true melody.  Herein Bach excels all the composers in the world. At least, I have found no one to equal him in music known to me.  Even in his four-part writing we can, not infrequently, leave out the upper and lower parts and still find the middle parts melodious and agreeable.\",\n",
       " 'But in harmony of this kind each part must be highly plastic; otherwise it cannot play its role as an actual melody and at the same time combine with the other parts.  To produce it Bach followed a course of his own, upon which the textbooks of his day were silent, but which his genius suggested to him.  Its originality consists in the freedom of his part writing, in which he transgresses, seemingly, at any rate, rules long established and to his contemporaries almost sacred.  Bach, however, realised their object, which was simply to facilitate the flow of pure melody on a sound harmonic basis, in other words, successive and coexistent euphony, and he succeeded with singular success though byunfamiliar means.  Let me explain my meaning more closely.',\n",
       " 'Between simple intervals there is little difficulty in deciding whether the second note must rise or fall.  And in regard to phrases, or sections of a phrase, if we analyse their structure and follow out their harmonic tendency, their resolution is equally clear.  But this sense of destination may be provoked in each part by different intervals.  As we have observed already, every one of the four parts must flow melodically and freely.  But to secure that result it will be necessary to introduce between the notes which begin a phrase and establish its general atmosphere other notes which often are not consonant with those employed in the other parts and whose incidence is governed by the accent.  This is what we call a . Each part starts from a fixed point, and returns to it, but travels freely between them.  No one has made more use of such progressions than Bach in order to colour his parts and give them a characteristic melodic line.  Hence, unless his music is played with perfect fluency, occasional passages will sound harshly and we may be tempted to accuse him of exaggeration.  But the charge is ill founded. Once we play them as Bach intended them, such passages reveal their full beauty and their attractive though bizarre dissonance opens up new vistas in the realm of sound.',\n",
       " \"But, to speak in detail of Bach's transgression of recognised rules.  To begin with, he admitted octaves and fifths provided they sounded well; that is, when the cause of their being forbidden did not arise. Everybody knows that there are positions in which they sound well, and others when they should be avoided, owing to the harsh effect or thin harmony they produce.  Bach's octaves and fifths never produce bad or thin harmony, and he was very definite as to when they could and could not be used.  In certain circumstances he would not permit hidden fifths and octaves even between the middle parts, though we exclude them only between the outer parts.  Yet, on occasion he used them in such a barefaced manner as to puzzle the beginner in composition.  But their use very soon commends itself.  Even in the last revision of his early compositions we find him altering passages, which at first sight appear impeccable, with the object of enriching their harmony and without scrupling to use hidden octaves.  A remarkable instance occursin the first part of the  in the E major Fugue, between the fifth and fourth bars from the end. I regret to this hour that, on looking over the later text, from which Hoffmeister and Kühnel's edition of that work is printed, I was so foolish as to reject Bach's amended reading there, merely because the harmony is unorthodox though more pleasing.  I stupidly preferred the older, more correct, and harsher reading, though in the later text the three parts run easily and smoothly. And what more can one demand? \",\n",
       " 'Again, there is a rule that every note raised by an accidental cannot be doubled in the chord, because the raised note must, from its nature, resolve on the note above.  If it is doubled, it must rise doubled in both parts and, consequently, form consecutive octaves.  Such is the rule.  But Bach frequently doubles not only notes accidentally raised elsewhere in the scale but actually the  or leading-note itself.  Yet he avoids consecutive octaves.  His finest works yield examples of this.',\n",
       " \"Again, Bach's statement that  should be regarded ratheran expansion than a violation of the recognised rule.  In general what is called an Organ point is merely a retarded close.  Bach, however, did not hesitate to employ it in the middle of a piece; a striking example occurs in the last Gigue of the  On a first hearing this Gigue, imperfectly rendered, may not sound well.  But it grows more beautiful as it becomes more familiar, and what seemed harsh is found to be smooth and agreeable, until one never tires of playing and hearing it.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's modulation was as original and characteristic as his harmony, and as closely related to it.  But the two things, though closely associated, are not the same.  By harmony we mean the concordance of several parts; by modulation, their progression through keys.  Modulation can take place in a single part.  Harmony requires more than one.  I will endeavour to make my meaning clearer.\",\n",
       " ' Most composers stick closely to their tonic key and modulate out of it with deliberation.  In music that requires a large number of performers, and in a building, for instance a church, where the large volume of sound dies away slowly, such a habit shows good sense in the composer who wishes his work to produce the best possible effect.  But in chamber or instrumental music it is not always a proof of wisdom, but rather of mental poverty. Bach saw clearly that the two styles demand different treatment.  In his largechoral compositions he bridles his exuberant fancy.  In his instrumental works he lets himself go.  As he never courted popularity, but always pursued his ideal, Bach had no reason to suppress the nobility of his inspirations, or to lower their standard for public consumption.  Nor did he ever do so.  Therefore every modulation in his instrumental work is a new thought, a constantly progressive creation in the plane of the chosen keys and those related to them.  He holds fast to the essentials of harmony, but with every modulation introduces a new suggestion and glides so smoothly to the end of a piece that no creaking of machinery is perceptible; yet no single bar—I might almost say no part of a bar—islike another.  Every modulation bears a strict relationship to the key from which it proceeds, and springs naturally from it.  Bach ignored, or rather despised, the sudden sallies by which many composers seek to surprise their hearers.  Even in his chromatic passages his progressions are so smooth and easy that we are hardly conscious of them, however extreme they may be.  He makes us feel that he has not stepped outside the diatonic scale, so quick is he to seize upon the consonances common to dissonant systems and combine them to his sure purpose.',\n",
       " \"Bach's treatment of harmony and modulation powerfully influenced his melody.  The strands of his harmony are really concurrent melodies.  They flow easily and expressively, never engross the hearer's attention, but divide his interest, as now one now the other becomes prominent.  Even when they are noticeable they seem obscured by the melodic parts that accompany them—I say  for if the hearer is sufficiently instructed to distinguish the several melodies in the ensemble he will discover them to be more clearly defined by their accompaniment.\",\n",
       " \"The combination of several melodic lines obliges the composer to use devices which are unnecessary in homophonic music.  A single melody can develop as it pleases.  But when two or more are combined each must be so delicately and cleverly fashioned that it can be interwoven with the others in this direction and in that.  And here we detect one at least of the reasons why Bach's melodies are so strangely original, and his tunes so clearly distinguishable from those of othercomposers.  Provided that novelty does not degenerate into eccentricity or extravagance, and that clearness and facility of expression march with agreeableness, a composer's meritoriousnessis proclaimed in his originality. The one drawback is that the ordinary hearer cannot appreciate melodic beauties which are patent only to the expert.\",\n",
       " \"But Bach's melodies are not invariably so handicapped.  They are always original, it is true.  But in his free compositions the melodies are so natural and spontaneous that, while they sound differently from those of other composers, their naturalness, and the sincerity of feeling that inspires them, make them intelligible to every listener.  Most of the Preludes in the  as well as a number of movements in the Suites are of this character.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's melody, then, bears the unmistakable stamp of originality.  And so does his passage work, as it is called.  Such novelty, originality, and brilliancy are not found in any other composer.  Examples are to be found in all Bach's Clavier works. But the most striking and original are inthe  in the first Part of the  in the  and the  In the last particularly Bach's fertility impresses us.  The greater part of its passage work is in the form of harmonic arpeggios whose richness and originality match the chords they represent.\",\n",
       " \"In order to realise the care and skill Bach expended on his melody and harmony, and how he put the very best of his genius into his work, I need only instance his efforts to construct a composition incapable of being harmonised with another melodic part.  In his day it was regarded as imperative to perfect the harmonic structure of part-writing.  Consequently the composer was careful to complete his chords and leave no door open for another part.  So far the rule had been followed more or less closely in music for two, three, and four parts, and Bach observed it in such cases.  But he applied it also to compositions consisting of a single part, and to a deliberate experiment in this form we owe the six Violin and the six Violoncello Solo Suites,which have no accompaniment and do not require one.  So remarkable is Bach's skill that the solo instrument actually produces all the notes required for complete harmony, rendering a second part unnecessary and even impossible.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's melody never palls on us, because of the presence in it of those qualities to which I have referred.  It remains like Nature herself.  In his earlier works, in which we find him still in bondage to the prevailing mode, there is a good deal that to-day seems antiquated.  But when, as in his later works, he draws his melody from the living wells of inspiration and cuts himself adrift from convention, all is as fresh and new as if it had been written yesterday.  Of how many compositions of that period can the same be said?  Even the works of ingenious composers like Reinhard Keiser and Handel have become old-fashioned sooner than we or their composers might have supposed.  Like other caterers for the public, they were obliged to pander to its taste, and such music endures no longer than the standard which produced it.  Nothing is more inconstant and fickle than popular caprice and, in general, what is called fashion.  It must be admitted, however, that Handel's Fugues are not yet out of date,though there are probably few of his Arias that we now find agreeable.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's melody and harmony are rendered still more distinctive by their inexhaustible rhythmic variety.  Hitherto we have discussed his music merely subjectively as harmony and melody.  But to display vivacity and variety music needs to be uttered with rhythmic point and vigour.  More than those of any other period composers of Bach's time found no difficulty in this, for they acquired facility in the management of rhythm in the which held the place of our  Between the initial Prelude and closing Gigue the Suite includes a number of characteristic French dance measures, whose rhythm is their distinguishing characteristic.  Composers of Bach's day, therefore, were familiar with measures and rhythms which are now obsolete.  Moreover skilful treatment was necessary in order that each dance might exhibit its own distinctive character and swing.  Herein Bach exceeded his predecessors and contemporaries.  He experimented with every kind of key and rhythm in order to give variety and colour to each movement.  Out of his experience he acquired such facility that, even inFugue, with its complex interweaving of several parts, he was able to employ a rhythm as easy as it was striking, as characteristic as it was sustained from beginning to end, as natural as a simple Minuet.\",\n",
       " \"The source of Bach's astonishing pre-eminence is to be sought in his facile and constant application of the methods we have discussed.  In whatever form he chose to express himself, easy or difficult, he was successful and seemingly effortless.There is not a note in his music that does not suggest consummate ease of workmanship. What he sets out to do he concludes triumphantly.  The result is complete and perfect; no one could wish for a single note to be other than it is.  Some illustrations will make my point clearer.\",\n",
       " \"Carl Philipp Emmanuel, in the preface to his father's (), which he edited, says that the world was accustomed to look for nothing but masterpieces from Bach.  Some reviewers thought this praise exaggerated.  But if the term  is restricted to works written during the years of Bach's maturity it is nothing less than the truth.  Others have produced masterpieces in various forms which may be placed honourably by the side of his.  For instance, certain Allemandes, Courantes, etc., by Handel and others are not less beautiful, though less richly wrought, than Bach's.  But in Fugue, Counterpoint, and Canon he stands alone, in a grandeur so isolated that all around him seems desert and void.  No one ever wrote Fugues to compare with his; indeed, persons unacquainted with them cannot imagine what a Fugue is and ought to be.  The ordinary Fugue follows a rule of thumb development.  It takes a theme, puts another beside it, passes them into related keys, and writes other parts round them over a Continuo.  Certainly this is Fugue: but of what merit?  Persons who know no other not unnaturally hold the whole species in little esteem, and the player who hopes to make such commonplace material convincing will need all his skill and imagination.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's Fugue is of quite another kind.  It presents all the characteristics we are accustomed to in freer musical forms: a flowing and distinctive melody, ease, clarity, and facility in the progression of the parts, inexhaustible variety of modulation, purest harmony, the exclusion of every jarring or unnecessary note, unity of form and variety of style, rhythm, and measure, and such superabundant animation that the hearer may well ask himself whether every note is not actually alive.  Such are the properties of Bach's Fugues, properties which excite the admiration and astonishment of all who can appreciate the intellectual calibre their composition demands.  How great a tribute of homage is due to work of this kind, which exhibits all the qualities which lend distinction to compositions in other musical forms!  Moreover, while all Bach's Fugues of his mature period have the foregoing properties in common, each is endowed with peculiar excellencies of its own, has its own distinctive individuality, and displays a melodic and harmonic scheme in keeping with it.  The man who can play one of Bach's Fugues is familiar with, and can play, one only; whereas knowing one, we can perform portfolios of Fugues by other performers of Bach's period.\",\n",
       " \" To what a height was the art of Counterpoint carried by Bach's genius!  It enabled him to develop out of a given subject a whole family of related and contrasted themes, of every form and design.  It taught him to develop an idea logicallyfrom the beginning to the end.  It gave him such a command of harmony and its infinite combinations that he could invert whole themes, note by note, in every part, without impairing in the least the flow of melody or purity of his harmony.  It taught him to write in canon at all intervals and in movements of all kinds so easily and naturally that the workmanship is not perceptible and the composition sounds as smoothly as though it were in the free style. Lastly, it has given to posterity a legacy of works immensely various, which are, and will remain, models of contrapuntal form as long as music endures.\",\n",
       " \"I have written exclusively so far of Bach's Clavier and Organ work.  But in its expression music has two branches, instrumental and vocal, and as Bach excels in both of them, the reader will desire to hear somewhat respecting his vocal writings.\",\n",
       " 'It was at Weimar that Bach first had occasion to write for the voice, upon his appointment tothe Kapelle, which imposed on him the provision of music for the ducal chapel.  His church music, like his Organ works, is devout and serious, and in every respect what church music ought to be.  He makes a point also of not elaborating individual words, which leads to mere trifling, but interprets the text as a whole. His choruses invariably are magnificent and impressive, and he frequently introduces Chorals into them, making the other parts accompany their  fugally, as was the practice in a Motet.  As elsewhere in his works, the harmonic structure of his voice parts and instrumental accompaniment is rich.  The declamation of the recitatives is expressive, and the latter have fine Continuo parts. In his Arias, hardly one of which is not beautiful and expressive, Bach seems to have been handicapped by the inefficiency of his singers and instrumentalists, who constantly complained of the difficulty of his music.  If he had been fortunate enough to have capable performers the merits of his church musicwould have been established and, like his other works, they would still be sung and admired; for they contain treasures which deserve immortality.',\n",
       " \" Among the works composed at Leipzig I single out two Cantatas, one of which was performed at Cöthen at the funeral of Bach's beloved Prince Leopold, and the other in St. Paul's Church, Leipzig, on the occasion of the funeral sermon in honour of Christiana Eberhardine, Queen of Poland and Electress of Saxony. The first contains double choruses of uncommon magnificence and most affecting sentiment. The second has only four-part choruses, but they are so delightful and fresh that he who begins the work will not pause till he has reached the end of it. It was written in October 1727.\",\n",
       " \"Bach also composed a great number of Cantatas, chiefly for the choir of St. Thomas' School, Leipzig.The choir ordinarily numbered fifty singers, andsometimes more, over whose musical training Bach presided like a father.  He practised them so hard in Cantatas for single and double chorus that they became excellent singers.  Among these works are some which, in profundity of conception, magnificence, richness of harmony and melody, and animation, surpass everything of their kind.  But, like all Bach's works, and in common with other masterpieces, they are difficult to perform and need a numerous orchestra to produce their full effect.\",\n",
       " \"Such are Bach's most important vocal compositions. In minor forms of the art, for social entertainments and the like, he wrote little, though he was of a most sociable disposition. For instance, he is said never to have composed a song. And why should he?  They produce themselves so spontaneously that there is little call for genius to aid their gestation.\",\n",
       " 'It not infrequently happens that talented composers and players are incapable of imparting their skill to others.  Either they have never troubled to probe the mechanism of their own facility, or, through the excellence of their instructors, have taken the short cut to proficiency and allowed their teacher and not their own judgment to decide how a thing should be done.  Such people are useless to instruct beginners.  True, they may succeed in teaching the rudiments of technique, assuming that they have been properly taught themselves.  But they are certainly unqualified to teach in the full sense of the word.  There is, in fact, only one way to become a good teacher, and that is to have gone through the discipline of self-instruction, a path along which the beginner may go astray a thousand times before attaining to perfection. For it is just this stumbling effort that reveals the dimensions of the art. The man who has adventured it learns the obstacles that obstruct his path, and how to surmount them. To be sure, it is a lengthy method. But if a manhas patience to persevere he will reap a sure reward after an alluring pilgrimage.  No musician ever founded a school of his own who has not followed such a course, and to his experience his teaching has owed its distinctive character.',\n",
       " 'This is so with Bach, who, only gradually discovering his full stature, was thirty years old before unremitting application raised him above the difficulties of his art.  But he reaped his reward.  Self-discipline set him on the fairest and most alluring path that it has ever been given to a musician to tread.',\n",
       " 'To teach well a man needs to have a full mind.  He must have discovered how to meet and have overcome the obstacles in his own path before he can be successful in teaching others how to avoid them.  Bach united both qualities.  Hence, as a teacher he was the most instructive, clear, and definite that has ever been.  In every branch of his art he produced a band of pupils who followed in his footsteps, without, however, equalling his achievement.',\n",
       " 'First of all let me show how he taught the Clavier. To begin with, his pupils were made to acquire the special touch of which I have already spoken.To that end for months together he made them practise nothing but simple exercisesfor the fingers of both hands, at the same time emphasising the need for clearness and distinctness.  He kept them at these exercises for from six to twelve months, unless he found his pupils losing heart, in which case he so far met them as to write short studies which incorporated a particular exercise.  Of this kind are the  and the  both of which Bach wrote during the lesson for a particular pupil and afterwards improved into beautiful and expressive compositions.  Besides this finger practice, either in regular exercises or in pieces composed for the purpose, Bach introduced his pupils to the use of the various ornaments in both hands. ',\n",
       " \"Not until this stage was reached did Bach allow his pupils to practise his own larger works, so admirably calculated, as he knew, to develop their powers.  In order to lessen their difficulty, it was his excellent habit to play over to them the pieces they were to study, with the remark, It would be difficult to exaggerate the helpfulness of this method. The pupil's interest was roused by hearing the piece properly played. But that was not the sole result.  Without the help thus given the pupil could only hope to overcome the difficulties of the piece after considerable effort, and would find it much less easy to realise a proper rendering of it.  As it was, he received at once an ideal to aim at and was taught how to surmount the difficulties the piece presented.  Many a young performer, still imperfect after a year's practice, probably would master his music in a month if he once had it played over to him.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's method of teaching composition was equally sure and effective. He did not begin with the dry details of counterpoint, as was the custom of other teachers in his day.  Still less did he burden his pupils with the physical properties of sound, which he held to be matter for the theorist and instrument-maker rather than the composer.  He started them off at once on four-part harmony over a figured Bass, making his pupils write each part on a separate stave in order to impress on them the need for accurate harmonic progression.  Then he passed to Hymn tunes, setting the Bass himself and making his pupils write the Tenor and Alto parts.  In time he let them write the Bass also.  He insisted on correct harmony and on each part having a real melodic line.  Every musician knows what modelsBach has left us in this form.  The inner parts of his four-part Hymn-tunes are so smooth and melodious that often they might be taken for the melody.  He made his pupils aim at similar tunefulness, and until they showed a high standard of merit did not permit them to write compositions of their own.  Meanwhile he aimed at cultivating their feeling for pure harmony and for the order and connection of ideas and parts by familiarising them with the compositions of others.  Until they had acquired facility in those qualities he neither permitted them nor held them competent to put pen to paper.\",\n",
       " \"Bach required his pupils in composition to work out their musical ideas mentally.  If any of them lacked this faculty he admonished him not to compose and discountenanced even his sons from attempting to write until they had first given evidence of genuine musical gifts.  Having completed their elementary study of harmony, Bach took his pupils on to the theory of Fugue, beginning with two-part writing.  In these and other exercises he insisted on the pupil composing away from the Clavier. Those who did otherwise he ridiculed as   In the second place he required rigorous attention to each part and its relation to the concurrent parts, permitting none, not even an inner one, to break off before it had finished what it had to say.  He insisted upon a correct relation between each note and its predecessor.  If he came upon one whose derivation or destination was not perfectly clear he struck it out as faulty.  It is, indeed, a meticulous exactitude in each individual part that makes Bach's harmony really multiple melody.  Confused part-writing, where a note that belongs to the Tenor is given to the Alto, or , or the haphazard addition of extraneous parts to a chord which suddenly shows an increase of notes as if fallen from the sky, to vanish as suddenly as they came, are faults found neither in his own nor his pupils' writing.  He regarded his musical parts as so many persons engaged in conversation.  If there are three, each of them on occasion may be silent and listen to the others until it finds something relevant to say itself.  But if, at an interesting point of the conversation, an interloping voice intervened, Bach regarded it as an intruder and let his pupils understand that it could not be admitted.\",\n",
       " \"Notwithstanding his strictness on this point, Bach allowed his pupils considerable licence in other respects.  In their use of certain intervals, as in their treatment of harmony and melody, he let them experiment within the limits of their ability, taking care to discountenance ugliness and to insist on their giving appropriate expression to the character of the composition.  Beauty of expression, he postulated, was only attainable on a foundation of pure and accurate harmony.  Having experimented in every form himself, he liked to see his pupils equally adventurous. Earlier teachers of composition, for instance, Berardi, Buononcini,and Fux, did not allow such liberty.  They were afraid to trust their pupils to encounter difficulties, and short-sightedly prevented them from learning how to overcome them.  Bach's system was wiser, for it took his pupils farther, since he did not limit their attention, as his predecessors did, to the harmonic structure, but extended it to the qualities that constitute good writing, namely, consistency of expression, variety of style, rhythm, and melody.  Those who would acquaint themselves with Bach's method of teaching composition will find it fully set forth in Kirnberger's \",\n",
       " \"As long as his pupils were under his instruction Bach did not allow them to study any but his own works and the classics.  The critical sense, which permits a man to distinguish good from bad, develops later than the aesthetic faculty and may be blunted and even destroyed by frequent contact with bad music.  The best way to instruct youth is to accustom it early to consort with the best models.  Time brings experience and an instructed judgment to confirm the pupil's early attraction to works of true art.\",\n",
       " \"Under this admirable method of teaching all Bach's pupils became distinguished musicians, some more so than others, according as they came early or late under his influence, and had opportunity and encouragement to perfect and apply the instruction they received from him.  His two eldest sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emmanuel, were his most distinguished pupils, not because he gave them better instruction than the rest, but because from their earliest youth they were brought up amid good music at home.  Even before they began their lessons they knew what was good.  On the other hand, others, before they became Bach's pupils, either had heard no good music or their taste had been already vitiated by contact with bad.  It at least attests the excellence of Bach's method that even his pupils thus handicapped took high rank in their profession and distinguished themselves in one or other of its branches.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's first pupil was JOHANN CASPAR VOGLER, who received instruction from him in his early days at Amstadt and Weimar and, on Bach's testimony, was an exceedingly able player.  He became organist, and later burgomaster, at Weimar, retaining his professional position.  Some Choral Preludes by him for a two-manualed Organ with pedals were engraved about 1737.\",\n",
       " 'Other pupils of Bach who became famous were:',\n",
       " \"I have said already that Bach's sons were his most distinguished pupils.  The eldest, WILHELM FRIEDEMANN BACH, came nearest to his father in the originality of his genius.  His melodies have quite a different character from those of other composers.  They are exceedingly clever, elegant, and spontaneous.  When performed with delicacy, as he played them, they cannot fail to charm every hearer.  It is greatly to be regretted that he preferred to follow his fancy in extemporisation and to expend his genius on fugitive thoughts rather than to work them out on paper.  The number of his compositions therefore is small, but all are beautiful.\",\n",
       " 'CARL PHILIPP EMMANUEL BACH, who comes next, went out into the world sufficiently early to discover that it is a good thing for a composer to have a large public behind him.  Hence, in the clearness and easy intelligibility of his compositions, he approaches the popular style, though he scrupulously avoids the commonplace. Both he and his elder brother admitted that they were driven to adopt a style of their own by the wish to avoid comparison with their incomparable father.',\n",
       " \"JOHANN CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH BACH, Concertmeister at the Court of Bückeburg, imitated Carl Philipp's style, but was not his equal. According to Wilhelm Friedemann, he was the best player among the brothers, and the most effective performer of their father's Clavier compositions.\",\n",
       " \"JOHANN CHRISTIAN BACH, called  and afterwards  was the youngest son of Bach's second marriage and of too tender an age when his father died ever to have had lessons from him.  Hence, perhaps, the absence of Bach's style in his music.  He was, in fact, a popular composer universally admired in his day.\",\n",
       " \"Distinguished as a player, composer, and teacher, Bach was also an indulgent father, a good friend, and a loyal citizen.  His paternal devotion is shown by his care for his children's education, and he was equally assiduous in the performance of his civil and social duties.  His acquaintance was agreeable to everybody.  Every lover of music, whatever his nationality, was sure of a friendly reception at his house, and his sociability and reputation caused him to be seldom without visitors.\",\n",
       " \"As an artist Bach was exceptionally modest.  Notwithstanding his pre-eminence in his profession,a superiority of which he could not but be conscious, and in spite of the admiration and respect daily shown him, he never gave himself airs.  If he was asked the secret of his mastership he would answer,  a remark which made no allowance for his own exceptional genius.  His opinion of other composers and their work was invariably fair and generous.  Naturally, much of their work struck him as somewhat trivial, viewed from his own altitude.  But he never uttered a harsh criticism, unless it were to a pupil, to whom he held himself bound to say what he thought.  Still less did he presume on his acknowledged superiority to indulge in braggadocio, as often happens with performers brought into touch with those whom they regard as their inferiors.  Herein Bach's modesty went so far that he never spoke voluntarily of his frustrated contest with Marchand, though the latter was the challenger.Many absurd stories are told of Bach; for instance that, dressed up as a village schoolmaster, he liked to enter a church and ask the organist to let him play a Choral, in order to enjoy the astonishment excited by his playing, or to hear the Organist declare, He always ridiculed such stories, and indeed had too much respect for his art to make it cloak his vanity. \",\n",
       " \"At musical parties where Quartet or other instrumental music was performed, Bach liked to play the Viola, an instrument which put him, as it were, in the middle of the harmony in a position from which he could hear and enjoy it on both sides.  On those occasions he would sometimes join in a Trio or other piece on the Harpsichord.  If he was in the mood and the composer was agreeable, he would, as has been told already, extemporise a new Trio from the Continuo part, or, adding a new part, convert the Trio into a Quartet. But these were the only occasions on which he was ready to display his great powers before others.  One Hurlebusch, of Brunswick,a conceited and arrogant Clavier player, once visited Bach at Leipzig, not to hear him play, but to play to him.  Bach received him politely and listened patiently to his very indifferent performance. On taking leave Hurlebusch made Bach's eldest sons a present of his published Sonatas, exhorting them to study them diligently. Bach, knowing the kind of music his sons were wont to play, smiled at Hurlebusch's naïveté but did not permit him to suspect his amusement.\",\n",
       " \"Bach was fond of listening to the music of other composers. If he and one of his elder sons happened to be in church when a Fugue was played, directly the subject had been stated he always pointed out how it ought to be developed.  If the composer knew his business and fulfilled Bach's anticipations, he was pleased and nudged his son to draw his attention to the fact.  Is this not evidence of his impartial interest in other people's compositions? \",\n",
       " \"I have mentioned already the composers whom in his youth Bach esteemed, loved, and studied.  Later, when experience ripened his critical faculty, he had other favourites, among them Imperial Kapellmeister Fux, Handel, Caldara, Reinhard Keiser, Hasse, the two Grauns, Telemann, Zelenka, Benda, etc., and, in general, the distinguished musicians at Dresden and Berlin.  He was acquainted with all except the first four of those I mention.  In his youth Bach was intimate with Telemann. He also had a very warm regard for Handel and often expressed a desire to know him.  As Handel, like himself, was a famous performer on the Organ and Clavier, many in Leipzig and its neighbourhood wished to bring the two great men together.  But Handel, then living in London, never found time for a meeting during the visits he paid to Halle, his native town.  On his first visit in 1719, Bach was at Cöthen, only some twenty miles distant.  As soon as he was informed of Handel's arrival he lost not a moment in setting out to visit him, but on his arrival found that Handel had returned to England.  At the time of Handel's second visit, between 1730 and 1740, Bach was prevented from leaving Leipzig by indisposition.  But no sooner was he advised of Handel's arrival at Halle than he sent his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, to beg him to visit Leipzig, an invitation which Handel was unable to accept.  In 1752 or 1753, when Handel paid his third visit to Germany, Bach was dead. He had always expressed the strongest desire to know Handel, and the Leipzig people were disappointed in their wish to hear the two great men together.\",\n",
       " \"While Hasse was Kapellmeister at Dresden both the Opera and Kapelle flourished.  Bach had many friends at Dresden, who held him in high regard.  Among them may be mentioned Hasse and his wife, the celebrated Faustina.They often visited Leipzig and were admirers of the Cantor's rare talents.  Hence, at Dresden he was always received in the most respectful manner and often visited the Opera, generally accompanied by his eldest son.  When the time for their journey approached Bach would say in fun,  Innocent as the jest was, I am sure Bach would not have uttered it to any but his son, who already could distinguish between great music and agreeable trifles.\",\n",
       " 'Bach was never in a position to make what is called a brilliant fortune. He held a fairly lucrative office, but his income had to maintain and educate a large family.  He neither possessed nor sought other means of livelihood, and was too absorbed in his art and work to think of accepting engagements which, in those days, and to a man of his genius, certainly would have brought riches.  Had he possessed a taste for travel he would, as even one of his detractors admits, have  But he preferred a quiet domestic life, constant occupation in his work, with contentment and a moderate competence, like his forbears.  His modesty, however, did hot prevent him from receiving manifold proofs of regard and affection and marks of honourable distinction.  Prince Leopold of Cöthen, Duke Ernst August of Weimar, and Duke Christian of Weissenfels, all showed sincere regard for him, which must have been the more agreeable to him seeing that they were all sound judges of music.  At Berlin, as at Dresden, he was universally honoured and respected.  If we add to these testimonies the fact that he captured the admiration of all who heard him play or were acquainted with his music, then we may be sure that Bach,  received at the hands of Fame the recognition he valued most, and cherished it far more than the trivial honour of a ribbon or gold chain.',\n",
       " ' I add that, in 1747, Bach became a member of the  founded by Mizler, only because we owe to the circumstance his admirable Choral Variations on  He presented them to the Society on his admission and they were engraved subsequently.',\n",
       " \"To have produced so many great works in all forms of musical expression Bach necessarily must have been a prolific writer.  For if a composer be the greatest genius in the world, unless he constantly exercises his art he cannot hope to produce real masterpieces.  Superlative excellence is the fruit of indefatigable application.  Yet in Bach's case we should be wrong to acclaim as masterpieces all the products of his great activity just because masterpieces at length were the fruit of it.  Already in his early compositions we find undeniable evidence of genius.  But they are blemished by faults, passages poor in quality, extravagant, insipid, that are hardly worth preserving, though of interest to the student who wishes to trace from its source the development of Bach's genius.\",\n",
       " \"It is not difficult to distinguish with exactitude those of Bach's early compositions which are of the first excellence; for he has been at pains to give us the clue.  As he did not publish his first work until he was about forty yearsold we are justified in assuming the merit of what, at so mature an age, he thought worthy to put into print, and in concluding generally that all his engraved works are of first-rate merit.\",\n",
       " \"With respect to his unpublished compositions, and they are by far the most numerous, we must in order to distinguish their merit rely partly on a critical examination of their texts, partly on Bach's own judgment.  Like all great composers, he was continually working on his compositions with a view to making them still more finished.  Indeed, he actually attempted to improve some of them that were already perfect.  Any that were susceptible of improvement he improved, even those already engraved.  Such is the origin of the variant readings of his works found in older and more recent texts.  By constantly retouching his compositions Bach aimed at making them indisputable masterpieces.  In this category I place most of what he wrote before the year 1725, as I show in detail in the following catalogue.  A great many compositions subsequent to 1725, which for reasons easily understood are still in MS., bear too evidently the stamp of perfection to leave us in doubt whether to class them as early essays or as the finished work of an accomplished master.\",\n",
       " \"The following are those of Bach's works which have been engraved:\",\n",
       " \"The Variations are models of what such compositions ought to be, though no one has been so rash as to attempt to follow Bach's footsteps.We owe them to Count Kaiserling, formerly Russian Ambassador at the Saxon Electoral Court, who frequently visited Leipzig with Goldberg, already mentioned among Bach's pupils.  The Count was a great invalid and suffered from insomnia.  Goldberg lived in the Ambassador's house, and slept in an adjoining room, to be ready to play to him when he was wakeful.  One day the Count asked Bach to write for Goldberg some Clavier music of a soothing and cheerful character, that would relieve the tedium of sleepless nights.  Bach thought a set of Variations most likely to fulfil the Count's needs, though, on account of the recurrence of the same basic harmony throughout, it was a form to which he had hitherto paid little attention.  Like all his compositions at this period, however, the Variations are a masterpiece, and are the only example he has left us of this form. The Count always called them  and was never weary of hearing them.  For long afterwards, when he could not sleep, he would say,  Perhaps Bach was never so well rewarded for any composition as for this.  The Count gave him a golden goblet containing one hundred louis d'ors, though, as a work of art, Bach would not have been overpaid had the present been a thousand times as large.  It may be observed, that in the engraved copy of the Variations there are serious mistakes, which the composer has corrected in his own copy.\",\n",
       " \"The work consists of fugal Variations planned on the most elaborate scale. The composer's intention was to show in what a variety of ways the same theme can be treated fugally.  The Variations (here called ) are complete Fugues upon the same theme.  The last Fugue of all has three subjects, in the third of which the composer signs his name, B A C H.Bach was prevented from finishing it by the disorder of his eyes, and as an operation brought no relief the movement was never completed.  It is said that Bach intended to introduce four themes into it and to bring it to an impressive conclusion by inverting them all. All the Fugues in the work are equally smooth and melodious.\",\n",
       " \"To make up for the unfinished Fugue Bach concluded the work with a Choral Prelude upon the tune  which he dictated to his son-in-law, Altnikol, a few days before his death. Of the extraordinary skill it displays I do not speak, save to remark that even in his last illness it proclaims Bach's skill undiminished.  The pious resignation and devotion that characterise it move me deeply whenever I play it.  Nor should I find it easy to say which I had rather had been omitted, the Choral Prelude, or the conclusion of the unfinished Fugue.\",\n",
       " \"More recently Kirnberger edited, in four volumes, a collection of Bach's Chorals. They are published by Breitkopf.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's works, still in MS., consist of compositions for the Clavier, Organ, with and without other instruments, Strings, and the voice.  I will enumerate them in that order.\",\n",
       " \"It cannot be denied that, among other blemishes, the Inventions occasionally exhibit melodic poverty and roughness.  But finding them useful to his pupils, Bach eventually revised them and removed from them everything that offended his maturer taste, so that they now stand as masterpieces of pure music.  Moreover they are invaluable exercises for the fingers and hands and are sound instructors of taste.  There is no better introduction to Bach's larger works than they afford.\",\n",
       " 'It is remarkable that this piece, for all its technical skill, appeals to the most unpractised hearer, if it is performed at all tolerably.',\n",
       " \"These are Bach's principal works for the Clavier which can be considered classics. A great number of single Suites,Toccatas and Fugues, besides those already mentioned, have great and varying merit, but are youthful works. At the most, ten or twelve of them seem to me worth preserving, some of them because they would be useful as finger exercises, for which their author originally intended them, others because they are at least better than similar works by other composers.  As an exercise for the fingers of both hands I particularly single out a Fugue in A minor, in which the composer has been at great pains to write florid passages in order to give equal strength and suppleness to both hands.  For beginners a little two-part Fugue should also prove useful.  It is melodious, flowing, and not at all old-fashioned.\",\n",
       " 'The pedal is the distinctive feature of the Organ which places it above all other instruments, and gives it its magnificence, sonority, and majesty.  Deprive it of the pedal and you take from it the solemn and imposing tones which are its distinctive utterance, reducing it to the level of a  or Chamber-organ, an instrument relatively insignificant.',\n",
       " \"But an Organ equipped with a pedal must be able to employ it in its full compass, and both composer and organist must know the proper use of it.  No one excelled Bach in this knowledge.  Not only is his rich harmony and melody singularly adapted to the instrument, but he gave the pedal a part of its own, even in his early compositions.  Yet it was only gradually that he mastered its technique; for his Organ masterpieces belong to the period in which those for the Clavier began to be classics.  His early and immature Organ works are widely dispersed; for as soon as a composer begins to be distinguished everybody is anxious to possess a specimen of his art.  Public curiosity, however, generally dies down long before a composer comes to maturity,particularly if his work is over the heads of the public.  And this seems to have been Bach's fortune.  Consequently his mature Organ works are less familiar than his early efforts.  The latter, however, cannot possibly be admitted to a  edition of his works, and I mention here only those whose merit is as incontestable as that of the Clavier works enumerated in the preceding paragraphs.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's finest Organ music falls into three groups:\",\n",
       " 'There are few instruments for which Bach did not write.  In his day it was usual to play a Concerto or instrumental Solo during the Communion office. Bach composed many of these pieces himself, and always with a view to their improving the technique of the player.  Most of them are lost.  But two important works of another kind survive and to some extent compensate us.  They are:',\n",
       " \"Most of these works are now dispersed.  The Church Cantatas were divided between his elder sons after their composer's death.  Wilhelm Friedemann had the larger share because, being organist at Halle, he could make use of them.  Later, circumstances compelled him to part with them gradually.  I know of no other collection of Bach's larger choral works.  There exist, however, eight or ten Motets for double chorus, but they are dispersed in various hands. In the collectionbequeathed by the Princess Amalia of Prussia to the Joachimsthal Gymnasium at Berlin there are some of Bach's vocal compositions.  Their number is not considerable, but among them are the following:\",\n",
       " 'On the MS. of the last-named Cantata and of the Mass for double chorus (No. 3 ) there is a note by Kirnberger analysing the skill and merit of the compositions.',\n",
       " \"It has been remarked more than once that Bach, throughout his life, devoted much thought to the improvement of his compositions.  I have had frequent occasion to compare the original and subsequent texts of his works, and confess to have experienced both surprise and pleasure in observing his care to improve whatever he thought faulty, to make good better, and better perfect.  Nothing is more instructive than a collation of this kind, whether to the experienced musician or the instructed amateur.  I should like to see a supplement to the complete edition of Bach's works showing these variant readings. The collation would be in the highest degree instructive, and to attempt it is as appropriate to the works of the composer, a poet in sound, as to those of the poet in words.\",\n",
       " \"In Bach's early texts he often repeats a phrase to other words with some melodic variety, in a lower or even in the same octave.  In his riper experience he could not tolerate such poverty of workmanship, and cut out these passages remorselessly, without regard for the number and quality of the persons who had approved them in their original state.  There occur to me two good examples of this, the C major and C sharp minor Preludes in the first part of the  Bach revised them so drastically as to cut them down by one-half, sacrificing passages that he thought redundant.\",\n",
       " 'In other places Bach tends to be over-concise; he expresses an idea, but does not fully develop it.  The best illustration that occurs to me is the D minor Prelude in the second part of the   I possess several texts of it.  In the oldest the first transposition of the theme in the Bass and several other details essential to a complete development of the idea are wanting.  A second MS. gives the theme to the Bass wherever the latter is in a key nearly related to that of the tonic.  In a third MS. these addenda are developed more fully and are joined more skilfully.  But melodic details are present of doubtful relevance to the rest of the composition.  In a fourth MS. these disappear or are amended, so that, as we have it, the Prelude stands as one of the most beautiful and least faulty in the  Many people, no doubt, preferred the movement in its original form.  But Bach was not a man to be influenced by approbation or criticism.  He went on correcting until he satisfied himself.',\n",
       " 'In the early part of the seventeenth century it was the fashion in instrumental music to overload single notes with ornaments and add florid runs.  Lately it has become the fashion to do so in vocal music as well.  That Bach shared this disposition may be inferred from certain pieces that he wrote in this style.  An instance is the Prelude in E minor in the first part of the   But he soon returned to his natural better taste, and altered the movement to the form in which it is engraved.',\n",
       " \"Every decade has its own style of melody, distinctive of itself and evanescent.  A composer must carefully avoid it if he hopes to be listened to by posterity.  In his young days even Bach ran upon this rock.  His early compositions for the Organ, and the two-part  in their original form, are full of  such as the taste of his period approved.  His Organ compositions remain comparatively untouched, but the  he closely revised.  The public will soon be able to compare them in their first and later forms, as the publishers, with admirable spirit, have resolved to discontinue the present editionand to send out to subscribers a revised one based on Bach's corrected text.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's processes of revision so far mentioned, however, merely correct faults of form, that is, diffuseness or incomplete development of a musical thought.  But Bach employed other methods which are less easy to describe because they are more subtle.  He often rivets the style and character of a piece by changing a single note, strictly correct grammatically and yet disagreeable to an artist such as himself.  Even commonplace passages he could convert into phrases of beauty by the addition or alteration of a single note.  Only the most sensitive taste and trained experience can decide in such cases, and Bach possessed both in the highest perfection.  He developed them to such a pitch, indeed, that his brain eventually rejected any idea which, in all its properties and relations, did not accord inevitably and naturally with the whole composition.  Consequently his later works display such consistency of merit that all of them seem to have been cast complete in a mould, so smooth, facile and abundant is the flow of his rich fancy.  It is on the highest summits of the art that harmony and melody find their ideal union, and as yet Bach dwells there in majestic isolation.\",\n",
       " \"It is surely unnecessary to ask whether that artist is a genius who, in every form of his art, has produced masterpiece after masterpiece, of an originality which sets them above the achievements of all other ages, distinguished also by a wealth of originality and agreeableness that enslaves every hearer.  The most fertile fancy, invention inexhaustible, a judgment so nice as to reject intuitively every irrelevant and jarring detail, unerring ingenuity in employing the most delicate and minute resources of his art, along with an unrivalled technique—these qualities, whose expression demands the outpouring of a man's whole soul, are the signboards of genius.  The man who cannot find them in Bach's music either is not acquainted with it at all or knows it imperfectly.  One needs to be steeped in it thoroughly to appreciate the genius of its author.  For the greater the work the closer study is demanded for its apprehension.  The butterfly method, a sip here and there, is of little use.  But admirable as were the gifts Bach receivedfrom nature, he could never have become an accomplished genius had he not learned betimes to avoid the rocks on which many artists, some of them perhaps not less gifted than he, too often founder.  I will communicate to the reader some scattered thoughts on the subject and conclude this essay with an indication of the characteristics of Bach's genius.\",\n",
       " 'Even the largest natural gifts, coupled with the strongest propensity for a particular art, offer no more than fruitful soil on which that art may thrive by patient cultivation.  Industry, the true begetter of every art and science, is an indispensable factor.  Not only does it enable genius to master technique, but it stimulates the critical and reflective faculties also.  The very ease with which genius acquires and applies the apparatus of musical composition frequently entices it to leap over root principles in its plunge into deeper waters, or to fly before its wings are grown.  In such a case, unless genius is guided back to neglected fundamentals and forced to build itself upon the great examples of the past, it will inevitably expend its treasure uselessly and never attain to its promised dimensions.  For it is an axiom, that real progress can never be made, nor the highest perfection be attained, if the foundations are insecure.  If arduous heights are to be achieved, the easier obstacles must first be approached and overcome.  Guided by his own inexperience no one ever can hope to become great.  He must profit by the practice and example of others.',\n",
       " \"Bach did not founder on this rock.  His soaring genius attended an equally ardent industry which incessantly impelled him, whenever he found his own equipment insufficient, to seek guidance from others.  Vivaldi and his Concertos were the first from whom he sought counsel.  From them he turned to the principal Organ and Clavier composers of the period.  Nothing is more intellectually stimulating than counterpoint, and the composers Bach studied were distinguished by their mastery of it, as their fugal writing attests.  Hence Bach's diligent study and imitation of them pointed his taste and imagination to perceive wherein himself was lacking and what steps were needed to take him farther in his art.\",\n",
       " \"A second rock upon which genius often comes to grief is the public's undiscriminating applause.  To be sure, I do not undervalue public approval or commend without reserve the remark of a Greek teacher to his pupil,   Yet it is none the less true that many artists are thrown off their balance by exaggerated and often unmerited plaudits, particularly in their early careers before they have acquired self-discipline and sound judgment.  The public merely asks for what it can understand, whereas the trueartist ought to aim at an achievement which cannot be measured by popular standards.  How, then, can popular applause be reconciled with the true artist's aspirations towards the ideal?  Bach never sought applause, and held with Schiller:\",\n",
       " 'Like every true artist, Bach worked to please himself in his own way, obeying the summons of his own genius, choosing his own subjects, and finding satisfaction only in the approval of his own judgment.  He could count on the applause of all who understood good music, and never failed to receive it.  Under what other conditions can sound works of art emerge?  The composer who debases his muse to the popular mood either lacks real genius or, having it, abuses it.  For to catch the ear of the public is not a difficult task and merely connotes an agreeable facility.  Composers of that class are like artisans who frankly fashion their goods to suit their market.  But Bach never condescended to such artifices.  The artist, in his judgment, is the dictator of public taste, not its slave.  If, as often happened, he was asked to write something simple for the Clavierhe would answer,   He would choose an easy theme.  But when he began to develop it he always found so much to say that the piece soon became anything but simple.  If his attention was drawn to the fact, he would answer smilingly,   Nor was he prompted in this by mere contradictoriness, but exhibited the true artist spirit.',\n",
       " \"It was, in fact, the artist temperament that led Bach to make the great and sublime his goal.  For that reason his music is not merely agreeable, like other composers', but transports us to the regions of the ideal.  It does not arrest our attention momentarily but grips us the stronger the oftener we listen to it, so that after a thousand hearings its treasures are still unexhausted and yield fresh beauties to excite our wonder.  Even the beginner who knows but the A B C of his art warms with pleasure when he hears Bach's music and can open his ear and heart to it.  It was the true artist spirit, too, that guided Bach to unite majesty and grandeur of design with meticulous care for detail and the most refined elegance, characteristics which we rather seek, perhaps, in works whose object is merely to give pleasure.  Bach held strongly that if the strands are imperfect, the whole design is faulty.  His genius is sublime and impressive, and he never condescends to be frivolous even when he touches the lighter forms of art.\",\n",
       " 'To conclude: it was the union of astounding genius and indefatigable application that enabled Bach to widen at every point the domain of musical expression.  His successors have failed to maintain the art at the level to which he raised it.  If Bach was more successful, if he was able to produce great work of convincing beauty and imperishable as a model for those who came after him, we owe it as much to his application as to his genius.',\n",

       " 'To these may be added (? authentic) from B.G. XLII.:',\n",
       " 'Generally speaking, the Choral Preludes, other than those in the maturer collections made by Bach himself, may be regarded as youthful works (bks. 18, 19).',\n",
       " \"We have the statement of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach, confirmed by Forkel, Bach's earliest biographer, that his father composed five Cantatas for every Sunday and Festival of the ecclesiastical year.  Concerted music was sung at Leipzig annually on forty-three Sundays and sixteen week-days. Bach therefore must have written at least 295 Cantatas.  Of this number he composed at least thirty before 1723.  Hence approximately 265 were written at Leipzig.  But Bach's fertility does not appear to have outlived the year 1744.  We have reason, therefore, to conclude that the 265 Leipzig Cantatas were written in the course of twenty-one years, that is, between 1723 and 1744.  To complete that number Bach must have composed a new Cantata every month, a surprising but demonstrable conclusion.\",\n",
       " \"Of the 295 Cantatas only 202 have come down to us, three of them in an incomplete state. Of those written before 1723 the survivors are too scanty to indicate a rate of productivity.  But thereafter we have fuller materials for a calculation.  Bach, as Cantor, conducted his first Leipzig Cantata on May 30, 1723, and in the following sixteen months produced twenty-four Cantatas, at the rate of more than one a month. Beginning at the New Year of 1725 he wrote eighteen Cantatas in nine months, some of which, however, may belong to the years 1726-7-8-9.  But even so, his monthly average seems to have been maintained.  For 1730 we have, perhaps, ten Cantatas.  For 1731 about twenty survive, of which half a dozen may belong to 1732, a deduction which still preserves Bach's steady average.  In 1735 he produced actually nineteen Cantatas between the New Year and the following November, though not all of them are positively dated.  Thereafter his activity is less certainly measured.  But from 1736 till the end of 1744 he composed fifty-three Cantatas, at the rate, that is, of at least six every year, without making allowance for Cantatas written and lost.\",\n",
       " \"There are few phenomena in the record of art more extraordinary than this unflagging cataract of inspiration, in which masterpiece followed masterpiece with the monotonous periodicity of a Sunday sermon.  Its musical significance has been presented with illuminating exegesis by more than one commentator.  But its literary apparatus has captured little attention.  Yet Bach's task must have been materially eased or aggravated according as the supply of libretti was regular or infrequent, while the flow of his inspiration must have been governed by their quality.  Moreover, the libretto was the medium through which he offered the homage of his art to the service of God.  The subject therefore deserves attention.  However trivial, measured against the immensities of Bach's genius, the study will at least provide a platform from which to contemplate it.\",\n",
       " \"At the outset the opinion may be hazarded that the provision of his weekly libretti caused Bach greater anxiety than the setting of them to music, a task which he accomplished with almost magical facility. It is true that from the early part of the 18th century cycles of Cantata texts for the Church's year were not infrequently published.  Bach was in more or less intimate touch with the authors of four, perhaps five, printed collections of the kind.  But he used them with surprising infrequency.  Neumeister's published cycles provided him with seven libretti, Franck's with sixteen, Picander's with ten, Marianne von Ziegler's with nine, and Helbig's with two. He took three libretti from the Bible, and the hymn-book furnished him with eleven more. But all these published sources together only account for fifty-eight texts.  Bach possessed only one book that could assist his own efforts at authorship—Paul Wagner's eight-volumed Hymn-book—whence he took the stanzas which decorate his Cantatas like jewels in the rare settings he gave them.  It was, therefore, mainly upon writers with whom he was brought into occasional or official contact that Bach depended for his texts.\",\n",
       " \"At the beginning of his career Bach was thrown upon his inexperience.  His earliest libretti, consequently, are tentative and transitory in their construction.  His first Cantata was written at Arnstadt for the Easter Festival of 1704. The core of the libretto is a seven-stanzaed Easter song by an unknown poet, eked out by two passages of Scripture, a Excitativo, Aria, and a verse of a congregational hymn.  The Aria and Recitativo are the only original numbers of the libretto, and there is littledoubt that Bach wrote them himself. But the whole libretto is stamped by his personality, and reveals the inveterate subjectivity of his religion.  For, disregarding the general message of the Festival, the libretto opens on the soul's personal longing for immortality and closes on its song of victory over death.  In construction it is archaic, a survival of traditions acquired from central and northern Germany through Bach's earlier residence at Lüneburg and intercourse with Hamburg.\",\n",
       " \"Three years passed before Bach produced his next extant Cantata. In the interval, on 29th June 1707, he resigned his Arnstadt appointment to become organist of the Church of St. Blasius at Mühlhausen. Here, within the space of ten months, he produced three Cantatas, the uniform character of whose libretti points to local and transitory influence upon the composer.  The first of them, written in August 1707, is a setting of Psalm 130, with the addition of two hymn-stanzas.  The second was performed on 4th February 1708, at the inauguration of the Mühlhausen Town Council, and consists of Old Testament passages, a verse of a hymn, and three original stanzas.  The third, a wedding Cantata, was performed at Dornheim, near Arnstadt, on 5th June 1708, at the marriage of Pastor Johann Lorenz Stauber to Frau Bach's aunt, and is set to four verses of Psalm 115.\",\n",
       " \"We can have little doubt regarding the authorship of these singularly austere libretti, so far removed in atmosphere from those of Bach's subsequent periods.  In fact, the clue is furnished by Bach himself.  A note in his handwriting on the score of the first of the threeCantatas (No. 131) states that he composed it at the request of Georg Christian Eilmar.  The man was a close friend, godfather of Bach's eldest daughter, Katharina Dorothea (b. 1708), chief pastor of the Church of the Blessed Virgin, and Consistorial Assessor, at Mühlhausen.  He was, moreover, an aggressive foe of Pietism, of which Mühlhausen was the citadel, and Bach's minister, Frohne, the protagonist.  Indeed, the two men waged so public and wordy a warfare that Bach's social relations with the one and official connection with the other must have been rendered difficult.  To his settled convictions regarding the fellowship of music and worship Pietism offered Puritan opposition.  In fact, its lack of sympathy eventually drove him from Mühlhausen, in hope, in his own words,  Eilmar, on the other hand, though he admitted the aesthetic value of music, conspicuously lacked the warmth and emotionalism of Bach's religious temperament.  To him undoubtedly we must attribute the cold austerity of the three Mühlhausen libretti and the suppression of the personal note already sounded in Bach's Arnstadt Cantata.  Nor did Eilmar's influence pass with Bach's departure from Mühlhausen. It is to be traced in the early libretti of the Weimar period.\",\n",
       " \"The Weimar Cantatas are twenty-two in number, of which all but three were written subsequently to Bach's appointment as Concertmeister early in 1714. He had been organist to the Ducal Court of Weimar since June 1708, a position which did not require him to compose for the Ducal Chapel. On the other hand, three Cantatas are attributed to the early Weimar years. But theycannot be positively dated, and their libretti bear such clear traces of Eilmar's influence that their composition may belong rather to the Mühlhausen period.  Their texts display Eilmar's preference for strictly Biblical material and a disinclination to employ secular forms.  The first of them is a paraphrase of the Magnificat. The second consists of four verses of Psalm 25, along with three simple rhymed stanzas which we have no difficulty in attributing to Bach himself.  The third,  (No. 106), was composed, Spitta conjectures, for the funeral of Philipp Grossgebauer, Rector of Weimar School, in 1711.  But more recently, and more probably, Pirro has expressed the opinion that Bach wrote it for the funeral of his uncle, Tobias Lammerhirt, who was buried at Erfurt in September 1707.  The theory accords with the suggestion that all three Cantatas belong to the Mühlhausen period.  If so, it is probable that the libretto, a very ingenious mosaic of Scripture texts, was written by Eilmar for the occasion.  It is the last in which we detect his influence.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's appointment as Ducal Concertmeister at Weimar can be placed between 14th January and 19th March 1714and, it is probable, was nearer the former date.  He seems to have produced the first Cantata his new post required him to write on Sexagesima Sunday, which fell on 4th February in that year.  From thence to the end of 1716 he produced nineteen Cantatas and collaborated with a writer whose libretti at length gave him a satisfactory literary medium.\",\n",
       " \"The new poet, Erdmann Neumeister, four of whose libretti Bach set to music immediately after his appointment, and a fifth a year later, was considerably Bach's senior. As far back as 1700 he had begun to write a cycle of Cantata texts for the Ducal Chapel at Weissenfels, and pubushed it in 1704, with an explanatory Preface referred to later. In 1708 he issued a second cycle for the Court of Rudolstadt, while in 1711 and 1714 third and fourth cycles were written for the Ducal Chapel at Eisenach.  All four cycles were reissued in 1716, with the addition of a fifth and a Preface, which lauded Neumeister as \",\n",
       " \"Spitta has dealt exhaustively with the evolution and construction of the Neumeister libretto.  It need only be remarked that it adapted a secular or operatic apparatus to the service of religion, and that the innovation, hateful to many, triumphed because of Neumeister's delicate handling of it.  He perfected the new form, however, in stages.   he insisted in his 1704 Preface,   But the restriction excluded from the Cantata its most appropriate material.  In his 1708 cycle he found a place for the chorus.  Finally, he admitted the Bible stanza and congregational hymn.  With their inclusion the Cantata libretto assumed the form familiar to us in Bach's use.  It represents a combination of secular Opera and ecclesiastical Motet.  The free Arias and Recitativi are derived from the one, the Bible stanzas and congregational hymns perpetuate the traditions of the other. Unity of design is stamped onthe whole by its general subordination to the Gospel for the Day.  Thus, at the moment when Bach was about to devote his genius to the Cantata, Neumeister opportunely provided him with a libretto singularly adapted to the end Bach had in view, and appropriate to the musical expression by which he proposed to secure it.  He adhered to it almost to the end of his life, and found unfailing inspiration in Neumeister's sincerity, delicacy, and uniformly religious outlook.  Neumeister's Arias, with a single exception, are hymn-like in mood and metre.  His Recitativi are reflective and prayerful, rarely oratorical or pictorial, simple communings upon the Gospel themes which the libretto handles.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's early introduction to Neumeister's texts is explained by the close relations between the Courts of Weimar and Eisenach, by his associations with his own birthplace, and his intimacy with Georg Philipp Telemann, Kapellmeister there, for whose use Neumeister's third and fourth cycles were written. Bach set, in all, seven of the libretti—four from the fourth cycle, one from the third, and two from the first, one of which (No. 142) differs so much from the published version as to raise the question whether Bach did not receive it direct from Neumeister in the form in which he set it.\",\n",
       " \"That Bach should have set no more than seven of Neumeister's texts is strange.  He shrank, perhaps, from appropriating libretti on which his friend Telemann had a prior claim. But the reason is found rather in the fact that at Weimar Bach discovered in 1715 a localpoet of first-rate ability who, with perhaps but one exception, wrote the libretti of all the Cantatas he composed during the last two years of his Weimar appointment.\",\n",
       " \"Salomo Franck, Bach's new collaborator, was Curator of the Ducal Museum of Coins and Medals at Weimar.  He was twenty-six years older than Bach.  But Spitta's conjecture, that the two men were not acquainted, is hardly tenable.  Both resided in the same small provincial town, both were in the Duke's service, and throughout 1715 and 1716 collaborated in at least ten Cantatas performed in the Ducal Chapel.  Moreover, though the Preface of Franck's first cycle is dated 4th June 1715, Bach had already set one of its libretti for Easter of that year. A second cycle of texts, of which Bach made little use, was published by Franck in 1717.\",\n",
       " \"Schweitzer, no doubt, is correct in his conclusion that Bach was drawn to Franck by his poetic insight, his mysticism, and innate feeling for nature.  It must be remembered, too, that his libretti were, in some degree, official.  On the other hand, Franck was Neumeister's inferior in ability to conceive a picture fit to express Bach's larger moods, and on occasion could descend to sheer bathos. But his texts have a rhythmic swing and melody which Bach found agreeable.  He set at least sixteen of them, and returned to them even after he settled at Leipzig.\",\n",
       " \"The circumstances which terminated Bach's service at Weimar are familiar, and need not be restated.  He received a new appointment at Cöthen on 1st August 1717, and took up his duties there, probably at Christmas, that year. His position was that of Capellmeister to the princely Court.  He never styles himself Court Organist, and his duties severed him for five years from the service of the Church, to which he had declared his particular dedication in 1708.  The Cöthen Court was unpretentious.  The Prince was a Calvinist.  Figurate music was not permitted in the Court Chapel, and its Organ was small and inadequate.  Hence Bach devoted himself chiefly to chamber music, and only two genuine Church Cantatas belong to this period of his career.  Both must have been written for performance elsewhere, possibly in connection with Bach's frequent Autumn tours as a performer.\",\n",
       " \"For both Cantatas Bach employed a librettist, otherwise little known, named Johann Friedrich Helbig, State Secretory to the Eisenach Court. In March 1720, more than two years after Bach's arrival at Cöthen, Helbig published a cycle of  for performance How they came into Bach's hands we do not know, but can readily conjecture.  They are indifferent poetry, judging them by the two specimens Bach made use of, and are uniform in construction.  The first movement invariably is a Chorus upon a text from the Gospel for the Day, or a Scripture passage closely related to it.  Two Arias separated by a Recitative follow. A Choral brings the libretto to an end.\",\n",
       " \"The first of the two Cantatas written to Helbig's wordswas designed for the Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity, which fell in 1720 on September 22. Spitta conjectures that Bach intended it for performance at Hamburg.  In fact, his wife's death postponed Bach's visit to that town until November, by which date the Sunday appropriate to the Cantata had passed. Spitta holds that the Cantata may have been performed, after all, during the visit. Schweitzer is sceptical. But Bach certainly expended great pains upon the score.\",\n",
       " \"The second Helbig Cantata is for the Third Sunday in Advent, and the date of it would appear to have been 1721.  It is one of the least agreeable of Bach's works.  Spitta  declares it a juvenile composition hastily adapted to a new libretto. Schweitzer expresses the same opinion, and Sir Hubert Parry finds the work   Its genuineness is discussed by Max Schreyer in the  for 1912, and more recently Rudolf Wustmann has insisted that it does not bear the stamp of Bach's genius. If it actually was composed in 1721, its production must have coincided with Bach's second marriage on December 3 of that year. In that case, his resort to old material is explicable.\",\n",
       " 'Only these two Cantatas were composed at Cöthen.  But later, at Leipzig, two others were manufactured out of secular material written there. It is unnecessary to refer to them, except to remark that in each case Bach appears to have been the author of the new libretto.  In the first of them it is clear that he was handicapped by the frankly secular metre of the original stanzas.  The second of them, originally a Birthday Ode to Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen, is a masterly conversion into a Whit-Monday text which, assuming that Bach wrote it, puts his literary facility beyond question.',\n",
       " \"Bach made the last move in his professional career on May 31, 1723, when he was inducted Cantor of St. Thomas' School at Leipzig, with particular charge of the Churches of St. Thomas and St. Nicolas.  Here by far the greater number of his Cantatas appeared, and 172 of them survive.  They are too numerous to be considered individually, and their classification is rendered difficult by the fact that the authorship of most of their libretti is conjectural and not ascertained.  They fall, however, into two large categories, each of which exhibits characteristics of its own.\",\n",
       " \"The dividing year, clearly but not arbitrarily, is 1734.  Before it and after it Bach was aided by new writers.  But the earlier period pre-eminently was one of experiment, out of which emerged the glorified hymn-libretto, or Choral Cantata, of Bach's last years.  That it sprang, in some degree, from the difficulty of finding good original texts in sufficient number may be granted.  That it was adopted as an avenue of escape from Picander's coarser work is a conjecture based, apparently, upon a prevalent exaggeration of Bach's dependence on that writer.  The fundamental reason which led Bach to the hymn-libretto undoubtedly was the fact that it most closely fulfilled the ideals which informed his work.\",\n",
       " \"The first Cantata performed during Bach's Cantorship reveals a new author, whose assistance, if the conclusion is well grounded, was at Bach's disposal throughout the whole of the earlier Leipzig period.  Spitta's keen insight failed him in this instance.  He betrays no recognition of the new writer, and occasionally attributes his libretti to Picander.  The credit of the discovery belongs to Rudolf Wustmann, though he fails to work it out to its fullest conclusions.\",\n",
       " \"No one can read the early Leipzig libretti without being struck by the number of them that are not only uniform in structure, but similar in tone and point.  They all begin with a Bible text, chosen frequently, but not invariably, from the Gospel for the Day.  Every one of them ends with a hymn-stanza.  Their Arias, with hardly an exception, are written in what, compared with Picander's rollicking dactyls, may be held hymn-metres.  Their Recitativi, almost invariably, are didactic or exegetical. They do not display the vapid rhetoric of Picander.  Nor do they express the reflective or prayerful mood that reveals Bach.  They are essentially expositive and, it is noticeable, are studded with direct or veiled references to Bible passages which expand or enforce the lesson of the initial text.  In a word, they suggest the work of a preacher casting his sermon notes into lyrical form, an impression which is strengthened by the fact that the libretto invariably opens with a Scripture passage and frequently blends the Gospel and Epistle for the Day in one harmonious teaching.  Spitta detected this characteristic.  But he failed to follow up the clue.  He speaks of one of these texts as a  a phrase concisely appropriate to them all.  Moreover, a remark of his, pointing the significanceof the god-parents chosen by Bach for his children—Eilmar, for instance—as revealing Bach's intimate associates at the moment, affords another clue to the personality of the new writer.\",\n",
       " \"Among the clergy of St. Thomas' during Bach's Cantorate were two men, father and son, each of whom bore the name Christian Weiss.  The elder was Pastor of the Church from 1714 till his death in 1737.  He was a cultured man, in touch with the University, and possibly formed a link between it and Bach, to whom he showed greater cordiality than the Cantor received from other clerical colleagues.  In 1732 his daughter, Dorothea Sophia stood godmother to Bach's son, Johann Christoph Friedrich, afterwards famous as the  In 1737 his son stood sponsor to Bach's daughter, Johanna Caroline. Nor can it be altogether without significance that the names Dorothea, Sophia, Christian, are borne by others of Bach's children by his second marriage.  There is sufficient evidence, therefore, that Bach's relations with the elder Weiss were intimate enough to support a literary partnership.  Moreover, circumstances lend weight to the inference.  For some years before Bach's arrival in Leipzig, Weiss suffered from an affection of the throat which kept him from the pulpit.  But, during the first year of Bach's Cantorate, he was able to resume his preaching.  If he was, in fact, the author of the libretti, we can have little difficulty in concluding that they and his sermons were built on the same text.\",\n",
       " \"So far as they can be identified—the attempt is somewhat speculative—Weiss provided Bach with at least thirty-three libretti.  He set five of them in 1723, three in 1724, nine in or about 1725, one in 1727, two in 1730, six in 1731, three in 1732, and four in the later Leipzig period. Fourteen others bear a constructionalresemblance to Weiss's texts, but their character refers them rather to Bach or Picander.  Even so, if we do not exaggerate his activity, Weiss seems to have written at least one-sixth of the Leipzig libretti and more than a quarter of those of the earlier period.  Without a doubt he eased a difficult situation in Bach's experience before his regular association with Picander began.\",\n",
       " \"Apart from their revelation of Christian Weiss, the libretti of Bach's first year at Leipzig do not call for comment.  Franck and Neumeister appear among them, and we trace Bach's hand in nine. But at Easter, 1724, he broke new ground with a libretto whence developed the Cantata form of his latest period.\",\n",
       " \"The Cantata for Easter Day 1724, is Bach's earliest setting of an entire congregational hymn.  Spitta suggests that he felt the fitness of giving the libretto an antique character to match the hymn's melody.  However that may be, Bach would appear already to have been groping towards the Choral Cantata of the late '30's.  And though he did not repeat the experiment until the Easter of 1731, he treated three hymn-libretti in the interval in a manner which shows him already to have worked out the essentials of the Choral Cantata form.\",\n",
       " 'Another landmark meets us a year and a half after the Easter experiment.  On September 23, 1725(?)—the Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity—Bach produced a Cantata whose Arias are set to words which had appeared in print in the preceding year.  Their author was a hack writer named Christian Friedrich Henrici, or, as he preferred to style himself, Picander.  His hand probablyis also traced in the libretto used by Bach on the preceding Sunday and again in that for Sexagesima in the same year. But the evidence is only inferential.  That he collaborated with Bach on September 23, 1725 (?), is incontestable, and the work defines the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership.',\n",
       " \"Spitta, who tells us all that is known of Picander, has sufficiently exposed his superficial literary facility.  He commenced to write sacred poetry in 1724, and on Advent Sunday of that year began a cycle of  so he termed them, upon the Sunday and Saints' Day Gospels.  He published them in 1725, when the cycle was complete. Three years later he issued a cycle of Cantata texts for 1728-29 in the Neumeister form. That he intended them for Bach's use is apparent in the fact that he expressly dedicated them to the service of   But Bach made the sparest use of them and of the earlier  alike.  From the latter he took not one libretto. Of the 1728-29 cycle he used only eight texts. One more libretto can be referred to Picander's later publications, and of six others we can be sure that they are based upon his texts. In other words, of the original libretti of the Leipzig period we can trace Picander's hand positively in no more than fifteen.\",\n",
       " \"It is necessary to emphasise this point. For Spitta has stated positively that Picander wrote  of the Leipzig libretti, and his opinion has been generallyaccepted.  But its correctness may be contested.  It is suspicious, to begin with, that Picander never published the texts which Spitta asserts him to have poured out in such profusion.  Spitta answers readily,   But the argument cannot stand.  Why should Picander have thought less of libretti actually used by his  than of those published for and rejected by him?—for Spitta does not venture to declare that as literature the rejected were superior to the accepted texts.  If out of a published cycle of libretti expressly written for him Bach chose only eight texts, are Picander's  as Spitta calls them, likely to have attracted him to a greater degree?  We can detect his hand perhaps in six Cantatas besides those already mentioned, and Bach relied on him exclusively for his secular texts.  One concludes, none the less, that Bach rarely accepted an original Cantata libretto from Picander, and employed him chiefly on the Choral Cantatas of his latest period.  Excluding them, and adding the probable to the actual original Picander texts, they total only twenty-one, a fraction inadequate to support Spitta's sweeping statement.\",\n",
       " 'From the advent of Picander in 1725, to the end of the first Leipzig period nine years later, Bach does not seem to have gone outside the circle of familial authors for his regular Cantata texts.  On October 17, 1727, however, he produced a funeral Cantata, or  in memory of the late Queen of Poland, the libretto of which was written by Professor J. C. Gottsched.  The partnership, in fact, was accidental: the libretto was supplied to Bach with the commission to set it to music, and, so far as is known, Gottsched and he did not collaborate again.',\n",
       " \"So, reviewing Bach's activities during his first eleven years at Leipzig, we find that of the hundred libretti set by him to music Christian Weiss heads the list as the presumed author of twenty-nine.  Bach follows him with eighteen. Picander's hand appears in fifteen, Franck's in eight, Neumeister's and Gottsched's in one each.  Fifteen libretti are congregational hymns in their original or paraphrased form.  One is the  of the B minor Mass adapted as a Christmas Cantata (No. 190).  Twelve are by authors not identified.\",\n",
       " 'Passing to the later Leipzig period, seventy-two surviving Cantatas are attributed to the years 1735-50.  They reveal one, perhaps two, new writers.  The first of them, Marianne von Ziegler, was identified by Spitta in 1892.  She was the widow of an officer, resident in Leipzig, a cultured woman, in touch with University life, her house a salon for music and musicians. There is no reason to suppose Bach to have been of her circle, or that he was acquainted with her literary gifts.  Indeed the contrary is to be inferred from the fact that, though she published her poems in 1728, he does not seem to have known them until seven years later, when he used them for nine consecutive Sundays and Festivals in 1735, beginning on the Third Sunday after Easter, and ending on Trinity Sunday.',\n",
       " \"In addition to these nine libretti, both Spittaand Schweitzer attribute to her the text of Bach's Cantata for the Second Sunday after Easter in the same year. It is uniform in construction with the authentic nine, but is not among the authoress's published works. Wustmannfinds the tone of the libretto less ardent and its rhythm rougher than those published under her name.  Admitting the soundness of Wustmann's criticism, one hazards the opinion that the challenged text was written at the period when Bach set it, namely, in 1735, eight years after the poetess published her earlier texts.  The difference of time may account for the difference of texture to which Wustmann draws attention, but leaves undecided the question whether Bach was drawn to the earlier through the later and unpublished texts or vice versa.  It is quite probable that he set other libretti by the same writer, though Schweitzer's attribution to her of a second text for Ascension Day, 1735, must be rejected.\",\n",
       " \"It is worth noticing, since it certainly reveals Bach's preference, that Marianne von Ziegler's libretti are constructed almost invariably in the Weiss form.  Every one of them but three opens with a Bible passage, invariably taken from St. John's Gospel, which provides the Gospel for the Day from the First Sunday after Easter down to Trinity Sunday, excepting Ascension Day.  All but one (No. 68) of the libretti conclude with a Choral, and their Arias are hymn-like in metre.  The tone of them, however, is warmer, more personal, less didactic than the Weiss texts.  That Bach regarded them with particular favour is apparent in the circumstance that he took the trouble to revise all but one of them. That they stirred his genius deeply is visible in the settings he gave them.\",\n",
       " \"After 1735 the chronology of the Cantatas is not certainly ascertained.  Of those that fall after the Ziegler year, as we may term it, the majority can only be dated approximately as circa 1740, that is, anywhere between 1735 and 1744.  Nor, except rarely, can we detect in their libretti the work of those on whom Bach elsewhere relied.  Weiss, who died late in 1737, is only an occasional contributor.  The texts of this period, in fact, are the outcome of Bach's own experiments in libretto form.  Thirty-three of them are Choral Cantatas, whose evolution it remains to trace concisely.\",\n",
       " \"That Bach should have turned to Lutheran hymnody, chiefly of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that the Cantatas built upon it should be his most perfect religious work is not surprising.  The hymns and their melodies were the foundations upon which the temple of German Protestantism had been reared.  They appealed vividly and powerfully to Bach's spiritual nature, and profoundly influenced his musical utterance.  His whole career, as Sir Hubert Parry points out, was an effort to widen his means for self-expression.  And the Choral Cantata, in effect, was the reconciliation or blending of this self-discipline.  It was the supreme achievement of Bach's genius to assert the faith and idealism of Lutheran hymnody with the fullest resources of his technique.\",\n",
       " \"It is not our task to consider the hymn libretto in its relation to the structure of Bach's latest Cantatas.  Necessarily it tied him to a stereotyped design, which he clung to with greater persistency because it exactly fulfilled his devotional purpose.  But experience compelled him, after a brief trial, to discard the simple hymn libretto.  In the earlier Leipzig years as many as eight Choral Cantatas are set to the unaltered text of a congregational hymn.  In the later Leipzig period only two libretti are of that character.  Bach, in fact, soon realised that, while the unaltered hymn-stanza, with its uniform metre and balanced rhyme, was appropriate to the simple Choral or elaborate Fantasia, it was unmalleable for use as an Aria or Recitative.  Hence, retaining the unaltered Hymn-stanza for the musical movementscongruous to it, he was led to paraphrase, in free madrigal form, those stanzas which he selected for the Arias and Recitativi.\",\n",
       " \"As early as September 16, 1725, Bach was moving towards this solution.  And it is significant that Picander's hand is visible in the libretto.  The next example occurs three years later, and again reveals Picander's authorship.  Two other instances also occur in the early Leipzig period. To that point, however, it is clear that Bach was not satisfied as to the most effective treatment of the hymn-libretto.  But in the second Leipzig period, after his collaboration with Marianne von Ziegler, he arrived at and remained constant to a uniform design.  Of the thirty-nine Choral Cantatas of the whole period only two exhibit the earlier form.  Of all the others the libretto consists partly of unaltered hymn-stanzas—invariably used for the first and last movements, and occasionally elsewhere—but chiefly of paraphrased stanzas of the hymn, whose accustomed melody, wherever else it may be introduced, is associated invariably with the hymn when the text is used in its unaltered form.  We, to whom both words and melody are too frequently unfamiliar, may view the perfections of the Choral Cantata with some detachment.  But Bach's audience listened to hymns and tunes which were in the heart of every hearer and a common possession of them all.  The appeal of his message was the more arresting because it spoke as directly to himself as to those he addressed.\",\n",
       " \"It would be satisfactory and interesting to point positively to Bach's own handiwork in these libretti, of which he set fifty-four in the period 1724-44.  Unfortunately it is impossible to do so, except, perhaps, in a single case,where we can reasonably infer that the libretto is his.  Of the rest, one is by Franck. In eighteen of them the hand of Picander is more or less patent. Nineteen we can only venture to mark  though Picander is probably present in most of them.  Ten are unaltered congregational hymns. There remain, however, five in which, perhaps, we detect another, and the last, of Bach's literary helpers.\",\n",
       " \"Wustmann draws attention to the libretto of Cantata No. 38, a paraphrase of Luther's Psalm 130.  He finds in it, and reasonably, an expression of  very alien to Picander's muse, and suggests the younger Christian Weiss as the author of it.  Like his father, he was Bach's colleague, the godfather of his daughter, and undoubtedly on terms of close friendship with him.  But if he wrote the libretto of Cantata No. 38, probably it is not the only one.  The same note rings in four more of the Choral Cantatas, which may be attributed tentatively to Weiss, though their ascription to Bach would be equally congruous.\",\n",
       " 'Returning, however, to the seventy-two libretti of the later Leipzig period we reach this result: More than half of them (thirty-nine) are congregational hymns, all but two of which are of the paraphrased type in which we detect the work of Picander, Bach himself, and perhaps the younger Weiss.  Of the remaining thirty-three original libretti Marianne von Ziegler heads the list with nine, and perhaps ten.  Bach follows with a problematicalsix, Picander with five, the elder Weiss with four, Neumeister with one. One text is taken from the Bible. Another consists of a single stanza of a hymn by Martin Behm. Five are by authors unknown or undetected.',\n",
       " \"But, as was said at the outset, the attribution of particular libretti to individual writers is conjectural, except in comparatively few cases.  Yet, unsatisfying as it is, this guess-work reveals with approximate correctness the extent to which Bach drew upon his own and other people's abilities for the texts he needed.  Summarising our conclusions, we discover that about one-quarter (fifty-four) of the 202 libretti set by Bach between the years 1704 and 1744 were provided by the hymn-book.  It is shown elsewhere that all but eleven of them are taken from Paul Wagner's volumes.  The elder Weiss comes next with thirty-three libretti.  Bach follows with thirty, Salomo Franck with twenty-one, Picander with twenty (exclusive of his arrangements of Choral Cantata texts).  Marianne von Ziegler contributes ten, Neumeister seven, Eilmar and Helbig two each, Gottsched and Martin Behm one each.  Three libretti are taken from the Bible or Church liturgy.  Eighteen remain anonymous.\",\n",
       " \"The literary qualities of the libretti are not under discussion here.  They have a characteristic, however, on which one cannot forbear from remarking.  Indifferent literature as, for the most part, they are—children of their period and blemished with its imperfections—they enshrine an extraordinarily interesting anthology of the religious poetry of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.  They expose the evangelical thought of Germany from the age of Luther to that of Bach,and are particularly rich in the lyrical fervour of the Reformation itself.  Of the seventy-seven hymn-writers whom Bach includes in his collection, so many as forty-four belong to the sixteenth century.  Only thirteen of them touch Bach's own period.  And a similar bias to the Reformation epoch is observable in his choice of the tunes of the Chorals, which are absent from only twenty-one of the Cantatas.  By far the greater number of them are coeval with the hymns themselves; that is, they date from the Reformation and behind it.\",\n",
       " \"Here clearly is the source of Bach's inspiration, the master-key of his art.  He touches Luther, is in a sense his complement, his art builded on the foundations Luther laid, consecrated to the ends Luther vindicated, inspired by a dedication of himself to God's service not less exalted—a great artist, a great Protestant, a great man.\",\n",

A secondary object, the foundation of a Bach Museum at Eisenach, in the house in which Bach was born, already has been achieved.  Bach Festivals have been held at regular intervals—at Berlin in 1901, Leipzig in 1904, Eisenach—in connection with the opening of the Museum—in 1907, at Chemnitz in 1908, Duisburg in 1910, Breslau in 1912, Vienna in 1914.

The Clavicembalo, or Harpsichord, as it is called in the text, was in general known as the  the strings being plucked, or flipped by a quill or metal pin, after the manner of the modern mandoline. The third instrument was the  or Hammerclavier.The Clavicembalo was also built with two keyboards, like an Organ, and a pedal-board provided with strings.  It was for this instrument that the so-called Organ Sonatas of Bach were written.  He possessed five Clavicembali, but not a single Clavichord at the time of his death.

       "['If there is such a thing as inherited aptitude for art it certainly showed itself in the family of Bach.  For six successive generations scarcely two or three of its members are found whom nature had not endowed with remarkable musical talent, and who did not make music their profession.19',\n",
       " 'Veit Bach,20 ancestor of this famous family, [pg 2]gained a livelihood as a baker at Pressburg in Hungary.  When the religious troubles of the sixteenth century broke out he was driven to seek another place of abode, and having got together as much of his small property as he could, retired with it to Thuringia, hoping to find peace and security there.  He settled at Wechmar, a village near Gotha,21 where he continued to ply his trade as a baker and miller.22In his leisure hours he was wont to amuse himself with the lute,23playing it amid the noise and clatter of the mill.  His taste for music descended to his two sons24and their children, and in time the Bachs grew to be a very numerous family of professional musicians,[pg 3]Cantors, Organists, and Town Musicians,25throughout  Thuringia.',\n",
       " \"Not all the Bachs, however, were great musicians.  But every generation boasted some of them who were more than usually distinguished.  In the first quarter of the seventeenth century three of Veit Bach's grandchildren showed such exceptional talent that the Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt thought it worth while to send them at his expense to Italy, then the chief school of music, to perfect themselves in the art.26\",\n",
       " \"We do not know whether they rewarded the expectations of their patron, for none of their works has survived. The fourth generation27of the family produced musicians of exceptional distinction,[pg 4]and several of their compositions, thanks to Johann Sebastian Bach's regard for them, have come down to us. The most notable of these Bachs are:\",\n",
       " 'Besides these three men, the Bachs boasted several able composers in the generations preceding Johann Sebastian,40 men who undoubtedly would have obtained higher positions, wider reputation, and more brilliant fortune if they could have torn themselves from their native Thuringia to display their gifts elsewhere in Germany or abroad. But none of the Bachs seems to have felt an inclination to migrate. Modest in their needs, frugal by nature and training, they were content with little, engrossed in and satisfied by their art, and wholly indifferent [pg 7]to the decorations which great men of that time were wont to bestow on artists as special marks of honour. The fact that others who appreciated them were thus distinguished did not rouse the slightest envy in the Bachs.',\n",
       " \"The Bachs not only displayed a happy contentedness, indispensable for the cheery enjoyment of life, but exhibited a clannish attachment to each other.  They could not all live in the same locality.  But it was their habit to meet once a year at a time and place arranged beforehand.  These gatherings generally took place at Erfurt, Eisenach, and sometimes at Arnstadt.  Even after the family had grown very large, and many of its members had left Thuringia to settle in Upper and Lower Saxony and Franconia, the Bachs continued their annual meetings.  On these occasions music was their sole recreation.  As those present were either Cantors, Organists, or Town Musicians, employed in the service of the Church and accustomed to preface the day's work with prayer, their first act was to sing a Hymn.  Having fulfilled their religious duty, they spent the rest of the time in frivolous recreations.  Best of all they liked to extemporise a chorus out of popular songs, comic or jocular, weaving them into a harmonious whole while declaiming the words of each. They called this hotch-potch a “Quodlibet,” laughed uproariously at it, and roused equally hearty and irrepressible laughter [pg 8]in their audience.41 It is suggested that German Comic Opera has its origin in these trifles.  But the “Quodlibet” was a familiar institution in Germany at a much earlier period.  I possess a collection of them printed and published at Vienna in 1542.42\",\n",
       " 'But these light-hearted Thuringians, and even those of their family who treated their art more seriously and worthily, would not have escaped oblivion had there not emerged in the fulness of time one whose genius and renown reflected their splendour and brilliancy on his forbears.  This man, the glory of his family, pride of his countrymen, most gifted favourite of the Muse of Music, was Johann Sebastian Bach.',\n",
       " 'Johann Sebastian Bach was born on March 21, 1685,43 at Eisenach, where his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was Court and Town Musician.44 Johann Ambrosius had a twin brother, Johann Christoph, Musician to the Court and Town of Arnstadt,45 who so exactly resembled him that even their wives could distinguish them only by their dress.  The twins appear to have been quite remarkable.  They were deeply attached, alike in disposition, in voice, and in the style of their music.  If one was ill, so was the other.  They died within a short time of each other, and were objects of wondering interest to all who knew them.46',\n",
       " \"In 1695, when Johann Sebastian was not quite ten years old, his father died. He lost his mother at an earlier period.47 So, being left an orphan,[pg 10]he became dependent on his eldest brother, Johann Christoph, Organist at Ohrdruf,48 from whom he received his earliest lessons on the Clavier.49 His inclination and talent for music must already have been pronounced.  For his brother no sooner had given him one piece to learn than the boy was demanding another more difficult.  The most renowned Clavier composers of that day were Froberger,50 Fischer,51 Johann Caspar Kerl,52 Pachelbel,53 Buxtehude,54 Bruhns,55[pg 11] and Böhm.56 Johann Christoph possessed a book containing several pieces by these masters, and Bach begged earnestly for it, but without effect.  Refusal increasing his determination, he laid his plans to get the book without his brother's knowledge.  It was kept on a book-shelf which had a latticed front.  Bach's hands were small.  Inserting them, he got hold of the book, rolled it up, and drew it out.  As he was not allowed a candle, he could only copy it on moonlight nights, and it was six months before he finished his heavy task.  As soon as it was completed he looked forward to using in secret a treasure won by so much labour.  But his brother found the copy and took it from him without pity, nor did Bach recover it until his brother's death soon after.57\",\n",
       " \"Being once more left destitute,58 Johann Sebastian set out for Lüneburg with one of his Ohrdruf schoolfellows, named Erdmann59 (afterwards Russian Resident at Danzig), and entered the choir of St. Michael's Convent.  His fine treble voice procured him a fair livelihood. But unfortunately he soon lost it and did not at once develop another.60\",\n",
       " \"Meanwhile his ambition to play the Organ and Clavier remained as keen as ever, and impelled him to hear and practise everything that promised him improvement.  For that purpose, while he was at Lüeburg, he several times travelled to Hamburg to hear the famous organist,61 Johann[pg 13]Adam Reinken.62 Often, too, he walked to Celle to hear the Duke's French band play French music, which was a novelty in those parts.63\",\n",
       " \"The date and circumstances of his removal from Lüneburg to Weimar are not precisely known.64 He certainly became Court Musician there in 1703, when he was just over eighteen years of age.65 But in the following year he gave up the post on his appointment as Organist to the new Church at Arnstadt, probably desiring to develop his taste for the Organ and realising that he would have better opportunities to do so at Arnstadt than at Weimar, where he was engaged simply to play the Violin.66 At Arnstadt he set himself assiduously to study the works of the celebrated organists of the period, so far as his modest means permitted him, and in order to improve himself [pg 14]in composition67 and Organ playing,68 walked the whole way to Lübeck to hear Dietrich Buxtehude, Organist of St. Mary's Church in that city, with whose compositions he was acquainted already. He remained there about three months,69 listening[pg 15]to the celebrated Organist, but without making himself known to him, and returned to Arnstadt with his experience much increased.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's zeal and persevering diligence had already drawn attention to him, as is evident from the fact that he received in succession several offers of vacant organistships, one of which, at the Church of St. Blasius, Mühlhausen, he accepted in 1707.70 Barely a year after he entered upon his duties there71 he again visited Weimar and played to the Duke, who was so pleased with his performance that he offered him the post of Court Organist, which he accepted.72 Weimar promised[pg 16]him a particularly agreeable atmosphere in which to cultivate his genius.73 He applied himself closely to his work, and probably at this period achieved the mastery of the Organ that he ever afterwards possessed.  At Weimar also he wrote his great compositions for that instrument.74 In 171775 the Duke appointed him Concertmeister, a post which gave him further opportunity to develop his art, since it required him to compose and direct Church music.\",\n",
       " \"It was about this time that Zachau, Handel's master, died at Halle, where he was Organist.76 Bach, who by now had acquired a great reputation, was invited to succeed him.77 He visited Halle[pg 17]and composed a work as a specimen of his skill But for some reason unknown he did not obtain the post.  It was given to a clever pupil of Zachau, named Kirchhoff.78\",\n",
       " \"Johann Sebastian was now thirty-two years old. He had made good use of his opportunities, had studied hard as a player and composer, and by tireless enthusiasm had so completely mastered every branch of his art, that he towered like a giant above his contemporaries. Both amateurs and professional musicians already regarded him with admiration when, in 1717, Marchand, the French virtuoso, a celebrated Clavier and[pg 18]Organ player, visited Dresden.  He played before the King-Elector79 and won such approbation that he was offered a large salary to enter His Majesty's service.80 Marchand's chief merit was his finished technique.  Like Couperin,81 his musical ideas were weak to the point of banality, as we may judge from his compositions.82 Bach was an equally finished player, and so rich in ideas that Marchand's head would have swollen had he been equally gifted.  Volumier, Concertmeister at Dresden,83 was aware of these circumstances, and knowing that the young German had his instrument and his imagination under the fullest control, determined to arrange a contest between the two men in order to give his sovereign the satisfaction of judging their merits.  With the King's approbation, a message was dispatched[pg 19]to Bach at Weimar84 inviting him to a contest with Marchand.  Bach accepted the invitation and set out at once on his journey.  Upon his arrival at Dresden Volumier procured him an opportunity to hear Marchand secretly.  Far from being discouraged by what he heard, Bach wrote a polite note to the French artist challenging him to a trial of skill, and offering to play at sight anything Marchand put before him, provided the Frenchman submitted himself to a similar test.  Marchand accepted the challenge, a time and place for the contest were fixed, and the King gave his approval.  At the appointed hour a large and distinguished company assembled in the house of Marshal Count Flemming.85 Bach arrived punctually; Marchand did not appear.  After considerable delay he was sought at his lodging, when it was discovered, to the astonishment of all, that he had left Dresden that morning without taking leave of anybody.  Bach therefore performed alone, and excited the admiration of all who heard him, though Volumier was cheated of his intention to exhibit the inferiority of French to German art.  Bach was overwhelmed with congratulations; but the dishonesty of a Court official is said to have[pg 20]intercepted a present of one hundred louis d'or sent to him by the King.86\",\n",
       " \"Bach had not long returned to Weimar when Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen, a good judge of music and a first-rate amateur,87 offered him the post of Kapellmeister.  He entered at once upon his new office88 and held it for about six years.89 At this period, about 1722,90 he visited[pg 21]Hamburg, played the Organ there, and excited general admiration.  The veteran Reinken—he was nearly one hundred years old—was particularly impressed by Bach's performance.  After he had treated the Choral An Wasserflüssen Babylon for half an hour in variation after variation in the true Organ style,91 Reinken paid him the compliment of saying, “I thought this art was dead, but I see that it survives in you.”  Reinken had treated the same Choral in a similar manner some years before and had had his work engraved, showing that he thought highly of it.  His praise therefore was particularly flattering to Bach.92\",\n",
       " \"On the death of Kuhnau in 172393 Bach was appointed Director of Music and Cantor to St. Thomas' School, Leipzig,94 a position which he[pg 22]occupied until his death.  Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen had great regard for him and Bach left his service with regret.95 But he saw the finger of Providence in the event; for the Prince died shortly afterwards.96 The loss of his patron affected him deeply, and moved him to compose a funeral Cantata containing remarkably fine double choruses which he himself conducted at Cöthen.97 While he was at St. Thomas' he was appointed honorary Kapellmeister to the Duke of Weissenfels98 and, in the following year[pg 23](1736), received the title of Court Composer to the King-Elector of Poland-Saxony.99 The two compliments are not of great consequence, and the second was to some degree corollary to Bach's position as Cantor of St. Thomas' School.100\",\n",
       " \"Carl Philipp Emmanuel, Bach's second son, entered the service of Frederick the Great of Prussia in 1740.  So widely was Bach's skill recognised by this time that the King, who often heard him praised, was curious to meet so great an artist.  More than once he hinted to Carl Philipp Emmanuel that it would be agreeable to welcome his father to Potsdam, and as Bach did not appear, desired to know the reason.  Carl Philipp did not fail to acquaint his father with the King's interest.  But for some time Bach was too occupied with his duties to accede to the invitation.  However, as Carl Philipp continued to urge him, he set out for Potsdam towards the end of 1747, in company with his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann.101 It was the King's custom to hold a private concert [pg 24]every evening, and to take part on the flute in a Concerto or two. One evening,102 when he had got out his flute and the musicians were at their desks, an official brought him a list of the strangers newly arrived at Potsdam.  Flute in hand the King ran through the names, and suddenly turning to the waiting musicians, said with considerable excitement, “Gentlemen, Old Bach has arrived.”  The flute was put away for the evening, and Bach, who had alighted at his son's lodging, was summoned immediately to the Palace.  Wilhelm Friedemann, who accompanied his father, often told me the story.  Nor am I likely to forget the racy manner in which he related it.  The courtesy of those days demanded rather prolix compliments, and the first introduction of Bach to so illustrious a monarch, into whose presence he had hurried without being allowed time to change his travelling dress for a Cantor's black gown, obviously invited ceremonial speeches on both sides.  I will not dwell on them; Wilhelm Friedemann related[pg 25]a lengthy and formal conversation between the King and the Cantor.103\",\n",
       " \"More worthy of record is the fact that the King gave up his concert for that evening and invited Bach, already known as “Old Bach,” to try the Silbermann pianofortes104 which stood in various parts of the Palace.105 Accompanied from room to room by the King and the musicians, Bach tried the instruments and improvised upon them before his illustrious companion.  After some time he asked the King to give him a subject for a Fugue, that he might treat it extempore.  The King did so, and expressed his astonishment at Bach's profound skill in developing it.  Anxious to see to what lengths the art could be carried, the King desired Bach to improvise a six-part Fugue.  But as every subject is not suitable for polyphonic[pg 26]treatment, Bach himself chose a theme and, to the astonishment of all who were present, developed it with the skill and distinction he had shown in treating the King's subject.  His Majesty expressed a wish to hear him on the Organ also. Accordingly, next day, Bach inspected all the Organs in Potsdam,106 as the evening before he had tried the Silbermann pianofortes. On his return to Leipzig he developed the King's theme in three and six parts, added Canones diversi upon it, engraved the whole under the title Musikalisches Opfer and dedicated it to the royal author of the theme.107\",\n",
       " \" His visit to Potsdam was Bach's last journey.  The indefatigable diligence he had shown all his life, and particularly in his younger years, when successive days and nights were given to study, seriously affected his eye-sight.  The weakness grew with age and became very distressing in character.  On the advice of friends who placed great confidence in the skill of a London oculist lately come to Leipzig,108 Bach submitted to an[pg 27]operation, which twice failed.  He lost his sight completely in consequence, and his hitherto vigorous constitution was undermined by the drugs administered to him.  He sank gradually for full half a year, and expired on the evening of July 30, 1760, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.109 Ten days before his death110 he was suddenly able to see again and to bear the light.  A few hours later he was seized by an apoplexy and inflammatory fever, and notwithstanding all possible medical aid, his weakened frame succumbed to the attack.\",\n",
       " 'Such was the career of this remarkable man.  I will only add that he was twice married, and that he had by his first wife seven, and by his second wife thirteen children; in all, eleven sons and nine daughters.111 All of his sons had an[pg 28]admirable talent for music, but only the elder ones fully developed it.112',\n",
       " \"Bach was inducted into his office as Cantor of St. Thomas' School at nine o'clock on the morning of Monday, May 31, 1723.  He died in his official residence there at a quarter to nine on the evening of Tuesday, July 28, 1750.  He was buried early on the morning of Friday, July 31, in the churchyard of St. John's, Leipzig.\",\n",
       " \"The announcement of his death, made from the pulpit of St. Thomas' on the day of his funeral, described him as “Court Composer to His Majesty the King of Poland and Electoral and Serene Highness of Saxony, Kapellmeister to His Highness the Prince of Anhalt-Cothen, and Cantor to St. Thomas' School of this town.”  Bach usually designated himself “Director Chori Musici Lipsiensis,” or shortly, “Director Musices.”  Circumstances led him to emphasise a title which asserted a musical prerogative not confined to the School and the churches it served.\",\n",
       " \"The Cantor of St. Thomas' was charged formerly with the musical direction of four Leipzig [pg 29]churches: St. Thomas', St. Nicolas', St. Peter's, and the New Church.  He was also responsible for the music in the University Church of St. Paul, the so-called “old service,” held originally on the Festivals of Easter, Whit, Christmas, and the Reformation, and once during each University quarter. On high days music also had to be provided at St. John's Church. \",\n",
       " \"Bach, as Cantor, succeeded to a more restricted responsibility, which dated from the early years of the eighteenth century.  The New Church, originally the Church of the Franciscans, had been restored to use in 1699.  In 1704 Georg Philipp Telemann, who came to Leipzig as a law student three years before, was appointed Organist there. He also founded the Collegium Musicum, or University Musical Society, a farther slight upon the Cantor's position.  Not until 1729 did the Society pass under Bach's direction and its members become available as auxiliaries in the church choirs under his charge.  Notwithstanding that Bach's predecessor Kuhnau had protested against Telemann's independence, the direction of the New Church's music passed out of the Cantor's control, though the School continued to provide the choristers.  Six years later the University Church of St. Paul also began an independent course.  In 1710 the authorities resolved to hold a University service in the church every Sunday. Kuhnau asserted his prerogative as Cantor. But[pg 30]he was only able to maintain it by offering to provide the music for the “new service” as well as for the “old service” at the fee of twelve thalers which the University so far had paid for the latter.  After his death the University appointed (April 3, 1723) Johann Gottlieb Görner, already Organist of St. Nicolas' since 1721, to control the music both of the “old” and “new” services, for which the University provided the choir.  Not until after a direct appeal to the King did Bach succeed, in 1726, in compelling the University to restore to the Cantor his emoluments in regard to the “old service,” the conduct of which had been restored to him on his appointment as Cantor.  The “new service” remained under Görner's direction.  As to St. Peter's, its services, which had entirely ceased, were revived in 1711. The music, however, was simple, and consisted only of hymns.\",\n",
       " \"Thus Bach, as Cantor, was responsible for the music in the two principal churches, St. Thomas' and St. Nicolas'.  The School also provided the choir for St. Peter's and the New Church.  The junior and least competent singers sang at St. Peter's.  The rest were pretty equally distributed between the other three churches.  At the New Church the music was performed under the direction of a Chorpräfect.  At St. Thomas' and St. Nicolas' Bach personally directed the concerted music.  On ordinary Sundays a Cantata or Motet[pg 31]was performed in each church alternately.  At the great Festivals, New Year, Epiphany, Ascension Day, Trinity Sunday, and the Annunciation, Cantatas were sung at both churches, the two choirs singing at Vespers in the second church the Cantata performed by them in the morning at the other church.  On these occasions the second choir was conducted by a Chorpräfect.  The principal Sunday service in both churches began at seven in the morning, ended at eleven, and observed the following order:\",\n",
       " \"Vespers began at a quarter past one and was a comparatively simple service; the music consisted of Hymns, a Motet, and the Magnificat. On the last three Sundays in Advent and throughout Lent neither Cantatas nor Motets were sung. The Organ was silent. On the three great Festivals the appointed Hymn for the season was sung at the beginning of[pg 34]the principal service, before the Organ Prelude: at Christmas, Puer natus in Bethlehem; at Easter, Heut' triumphiret Gottes Sohn; at Whitsuntide, Spiritus Sancti gratia.  During the Communion service the Sanctus and concerted music were sung.  A festal hymn followed the Benediction.  The three great Festivals were each observed for three consecutive days, on the first and second of which Cantatas were sung at both churches.  On the third day concerted music was sung at only one of the two churches.\",\n",
       " \"The other week-day Festivals for which Cantatas were provided were the Feast of the Circumcision (New Year's Day), Epiphany, Ascension Day, Purification of the B.V.M., Annunciation of the B.V.M., Visitation of the B.V.M., Feast of St. John Baptist (Midsummer Day), Feast of St. Michael the Archangel. The Reformation Festival was kept on October 31, or if that date was a Saturday or Monday, on the previous or following Sunday.\",\n",
       " \"On Good Friday the Passion was performed in the two principal churches alternately.  Leipzig adopted no official Hymn-book.  The compilation from which the Hymns were chosen by Bach was the eight-volumed Gesangbuchof Paul Wagner, published at Leipzig for Dresden use in 1697.  It contained over five thousand Hymns but no music, merely the name of the tune being stated above the Hymn.  For the[pg 35]most part the Hymns for special, and even for ordinary, occasions were prescribed by custom. Otherwise the power of selection was in the hands of the Cantor, and Bach's exercise of it caused some friction with the clergy in 1728.\",\n",
       " \"The provision and direction of the music at weddings and funerals was in the Cantor's hands.  He arranged the choirs and the music sung at the scholars' annual processions and perambulations of the town, which took place at Michaelmas, New Year, and on St. Martin's and St. Gregory's Days.\",\n",
       " \"Augmenting the School's choristers, the Town Musicians took part in the Church services and were under the Cantor's direction. Their numbers and efficiency were inadequate.\",\n",
       " 'Upon the staff of the School the Cantor ranked third after the Rector and Sub-Rector, and took a share in the general instruction of the scholars.  Class III. went to Bach for Latin lessons, a duty which the Council eventually permitted him to fulfil by deputy.  Singing classes were held by the Cantor on three days of the week, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, at nine and noon, and on Fridays at noon.  His instruction in singing was given to the four upper classes only.  On Saturday afternoons the Cantata was rehearsed.  Once in four weeks the Cantor took his turn to inspect the scholars.  Like the other masters, he was required to conform to the regulations[pg 36]of the School House, in which he lived.  He rose at five in summer, at six in winter, dined at ten and supped at five in the afternoon.',\n",
       " \" Holidays were numerous.  A week's vacation was given at the Easter, Michaelmas, and New Year Fairs.  At Midsummer the School had a month of half-holidays.  Whole holidays were given on the birthdays of the four upper masters.  There were no morning lessons on Saints' Days, on the occasion of funeral orations in the University Church, and on the quarterly Speech Days.  Hence, though Bach's office carried large responsibility, it left him considerable leisure for composition.\",\n",
       " \"As Cantor Bach had an official residence in the left wing of the School House.  In 1723, the Cantor's wing was of two storeys only, dwarfed by the greater elevation of the main edifice and under the shadow of the church.  Bach brought to Leipzig four children of his first marriage, and his second wife, Anna Magdalena, presented him with a son or daughter annually from 1723 to 1729.  The accommodation of the Cantor's lodging therefore rapidly became inadequate.  In the spring of 1731 Bach found a house elsewhere while an additional storey was added to it, which provided a new music-room, a good-sized apartment whence a passage led to the big schoolroom in the main building.  The new wing was formally opened and dedicated on June 5, 1732, when[pg 37]Bach's secular Cantata Froher Tag, verlangte Stunden was performed; the libretto being by his colleague Winkler.  From thenceforward till his death eighteen years later Bach's occupancy was not disturbed.  The wing continued to be the official residence of the Cantor until the School moved to the suburbs of the city in 1877.\",\n",
       " \"In addition to his residence, which he occupied rent free, the Cantor enjoyed a revenue from various and fluctuating sources, amounting in gross to 700 thalers (=£106 per annum).  His fixed stipend was only 100 thalers (=£15).  About 12 thalers came to him from endowments.  In kind he was entitled to 16 bushels of corn and 2 cords of firelogs, together with 2 measures of wine at each of the three great Festivals.  From the University, after his successful protest, he received 12 thalers for directing the “old service.” By far the larger part of Bach's income was derived from fluctuating sources.  They were of three kinds: (1) School monies, (2) funeral fees, (3) wedding fees.  The School monies represented perquisites derived from funds obtained by the scholars, partly by their weekly collections from the public, partly from the four annual processions or perambulations of the city.  From the weekly collections a sum of six pfennigs multiplied by the number of the scholars was put aside for the four upper masters, among whom the Cantor ranked third.  From the money collected at the[pg 38]New Year, Michaelmas, and St. Martin's Day processions the Rector took a thaler, the Cantor and the Sub-Rector each took one-eleventh of the balance, sixteen thirty-thirds went to the singers, and one-quarter of what remained fell to the Cantor.  Out of the money collected on St. Gregory's Day (March 12) the Rector took one-tenth for the entertainment of the four upper masters, and the Cantor took one-third of the residue.  For funerals one thaler 15 groschen was paid when the whole school accompanied the procession and a Motet was sung at the house of the deceased.  When no Motet was sung the Cantor's fee was 15 groschen. For weddings he received two thalers.\",\n",
       " \"Reckoned in modern currency, and judged by the standard of the period, the Cantor's income was not inadequate and served to maintain Bach's large family in comfort.  When he died in 1750, in addition to a mining share valued at 60 thalers, he possessed in cash or bonds about 360 thalers, silver plate valued at 251 thalers, instruments valued at 371 thalers, house furniture valued at 29 thalers, and books valued at 38 thalers.  His whole estate was declared at 1158 thalers, or somewhat less than the savings of two years' income.  But for the inequitable distribution of his property, owing to his intestacy, which left Anna Magdalena only about 400 thalers and the mining share, Bach's widow and unmarried[pg 39]daughters ought not to have been afflicted with excessive poverty, as in fact they were.\",\n",
       " \"At the beginning of his Cantorate Bach worked amid discouraging and unsatisfactory conditions.  The Rector, Johann Heinrich Ernesti, was over seventy years of age in 1723.  The School was badly managed, its discipline was relaxed, the better-to-do citizens withheld their sons from it, and its numbers were seriously diminished.  In 1717 the junior classes contained only 53 as against 120 in Ernesti's earlier years.  The proximity and operatic traditions of Dresden and Weissenfels also had a bad effect; the St. Thomas' boys, after attaining musical proficiency, were apt to become restless, demanding release from their indentures, and even running away to more attractive and lucrative occupations.  Moreover, the governors of the School were the Town Council, a body which had little sympathy with or appreciation of Bach's artistic aims and temperament.  To these difficulties must be added another.  The Town Musicians, on whom Bach relied for the nucleus of his orchestra, were few in number and inefficient.\",\n",
       " \"So long as Ernesti lived, there was little prospect of reform.  But, after his death, in October 1729, Bach made vigorous representations to the Town Council.  Already he had remonstrated with the Council for presenting to foundation scholarships boys who lacked musical aptitude.  The Council[pg 40]retaliated by accusing Bach of neglecting his singing classes, absenting himself without leave, and of other irregularities.  He was declared to be “incorrigible” and it was resolved (August 2, 1730) to sequestrate the Cantor's income, in other words, to withhold from him the perquisites to which he was entitled for the conduct of the Church services.114\",\n",
       " 'Bach was not deterred from offering, three weeks later (August 23, 1730), a “sketch of what constitutes well-appointed Church music, with a few impartial reflections on its present state of decay” in Leipzig.  The document reveals the conditions amid which Bach worked.  Its representations may be summarised:',\n",
       " \"The foundation scholars of St. Thomas' are of four classes: Trebles, Altos, Tenors, Basses. \",\n",
       " 'A choir needs from four to eight “concertists” (solo singers) and at least two “ripienists” to each chorus part, i.e. a minimum of twelve voices.',\n",
       " \"The foundation scholars number fifty-five, by whom the choirs of the four Churches, St. Thomas', St. Nicolas', St. Peter's, and the New Church are provided.  For the instrumental accompaniments at least twenty players are required: viz., 2 or 3 first Violins, 2 or 3 second Violins, 4 Violas, 2 Violoncelli, 1 Contrabasso, 2 or more Flutes, 2 or 3 Oboi,[pg 41]1 or 2 Fagotti, 3 Trombe, 1 Timpani.  To fill these places there are eight Town Musicians, and at the moment there are no players available for third Tromba, Timpani, Viola, Violoncello, Contrabasso, third Oboe (or Taille).\",\n",
       " 'To augment the Town Musicians the Cantor has been wont in the past to employ University students and instrumental players in the School.  Upon the former “at all times” he relies for Viola, Violoncello, and Contrabasso, and “generally” for the second Violins.  But the Council, by its recent resolution, no longer affords the Cantor the means to employ them.  To place the scholars in the orchestra weakens the choir, to which they naturally belong.',\n",
       " \"By presenting to foundation scholarships boys unskilled and ignorant of music, the resources at the Cantor's disposal are still farther lessened.\",\n",
       " ' Hence, Bach concludes, “in ceasing to receive my perquisites I am deprived of the power of putting the music into a better condition.”',\n",
       " \" No answer was made to Bach's memorial, and he contemplated resigning his position.  But with the advent of Johann Matthias Gesner as Rector in September 1730 a happier period dawned upon the “incorrigible” Cantor.  In 1732 Gesner procured the withdrawal of the Council's ban on Bach's perquisites.  The fallen fortunes of the School revived, and Bach did not again make an effort to leave Leipzig.  In 1736 the grant of the[pg 42]post of Hof-Componist to the Saxon Court gave him at length a title which compelled the deference of his civic masters.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's early misunderstanding with the University cut him off from association with the most dignified, if not the most important, institution in Leipzig, and deprived him of opportunity to display his genius beyond the radius of his Church duties.  The situation changed in 1729, when he became director of the University Society, and he held the post for about ten years.  The Society gave weekly concerts on Fridays, from 8 to 10, and an extra concert, during the Fair season, on Thursdays at the same hour.  It performed vocal and instrumental music and was the medium through which Bach presented his secular Cantatas, Clavier and Violin Concertos, and Orchestral Suites to the public.  The proficiency of his elder sons and pupils, and his wife's talent as a singer, were a farther source of strength to the Society, whose direction undoubtedly made these years the happiest in Bach's life.  He took his rightful place in the musical life of the city, and relegated to a position of inferiority the smaller fry, such as Görner, who had presumed on Bach's aloofness from the University and Municipality to insinuate themselves.  His increasing reputation as an organist, gained in his annual autumn tours, also enlightened his fellow-townsmen regarding the superlative worth of one whom at the outset[pg 43]they were disposed to treat as a subordinate official.\",\n",
       " \"The Leipzig of Bach's day offered various opportunities for musical celebration; official events in the University, “gratulations” or “ovations” of favourite professors by their students, as well as patriotic occasions in which town and gown participated.  The recognised fee for piecès d'occasion of a public character was fifty thalers.  Bach's conductorship of the University Society enabled him to perform festival works with the resources they required, and to augment the band and chorus needed for their adequate performance.\",\n",
       " \"Even before he undertook the direction of the University Society, Bach more than once provided the music for University celebrations.  On August 3, 1725, his secular Cantata, Derzufried-engestellte Aeolus, was performed at the students' celebration of Doctor August Friedrich Müller's name-day.  In 1726 he revived an old Cantata115to celebrate the birthday of another of the Leipzig teachers.  In the same year the appointment of Dr. Gottlieb Kortte as Professor of Roman Law was celebrated by Bach's Cantata Vereinigte Zwietracht der wechselnden Saiten. In 1733 the birthday of another Professor was marked by the performance of the Cöthen Cantata to yet another text (Die Freude reget sich). On November 21, [pg 44]1734, the lost Cantata Thomana sass annoch betrübt was sung at the induction of Gesner's successor, Johann August Ernesti, as Rector of St. Thomas' School.\",\n",
       " \"But Bach's activity as a secular composer at Leipzig was chiefly expended on patriotic celebrations.  His compositions of this character are particularly numerous during the years 1733-36, while he was seeking from the Dresden Court the post of Hof-Componist.  The first of these celebrations took place on May 12, 1727, the birthday of Augustus II. of Poland-Saxony, when Bach's Cantata, Entfernet euch, ihr heitern Sterne, was performed in the Market Place by the University Society.  The King was present and listened to the performance from a convenient window.  The music is lost.  Six years elapsed before Bach was invited to collaborate in another celebration of the royal House.  On September 5, 1733, less than two months after his application for the post of Hof-Componist, the University Society celebrated the eleventh birthday of the Electoral Prince by performing Bach's dramma per musica, Die Wahl des Herkules, or  Herkules auf dem Scheidewege. Barely three months later, on December 8, 1733, Bach produced another Cantata in honour of the royal family, Tönet, ihr Pauken, erschallet Trompeten, of which he was both author and composer.  On no less than three occasions in 1734 Bach did[pg 45]homage to his unheeding sovereign.  In January the University Society, under Bach's direction, performed his Cantata Blast Larmen, ihr Feinde to celebrate the coronation of Augustus III.  The music had already done duty in Dr. Müller's honour in 1725.  On the following October 5, 1734, when the King visited Leipzig, Bach's hurriedly written Cantata, Preise dein Glücke, gesegnetes Sachsen, whose first chorus became the  Osanna of the B minor Mass, was performed in the Market Place.  Two days later, on October 7, 1734, the King's birthday was celebrated by another Bach Cantata, Schleicht spielende Wellen, performed by the Collegium Musicum.  In 1738, having received the coveted title of Hof-Componist in the interval (1736), Bach performed a work—Willkommen, ihr herrschenden Götter der Erden—now lost, in honour of the marriage of the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony to Charles of Sicily, afterwards Charles III. of Spain.\",\n",
       " \"Apart from his musical activities and the house in which he lived there is little that permits us to picture Bach's life at Leipzig.  Association with his friends Johann Christian Hoffmann, Musical Instrument Maker to the Court, Marianne von Ziegler, J. C. Gottsched and his musical wife, Johann Abraham Birnbaum, among the Professoriate, Picander and Christian Weiss, Bach's regular librettists, suggests the amenities of an academic and literary circle. But the claims of[pg 46]his art and the care of his large family had the first call upon Bach's interest.  And few men had a happier home life.  While his elder sons were at home the family concerts were among his most agreeable experiences.  As his fame increased, his house became the resort of many seeking to know and hear the famous organist.  Late in the thirties he resigned his directorship of the University Society.  His sons were already off his hands and out of his house, and he turned again to the Organ works of his Weimar period.  Their revision occupied the last decade of his life, and the hitherto constant flow of Church Cantatas ceased.  Pupils resorted to him and filled his empty house, to one of whom, Altnikol, he gave a daughter in marriage.\",\n",
       " 'A man of rigid uprightness, sincerely religious; steeped in his art, earnest and grave, yet not lacking naive humour; ever hospitable and generous, and yet shrewd and cautious; pugnacious when his art was slighted or his rights were infringed; generous in the extreme to his wife and children, and eager to give the latter advantages which he had never known himself; a lover of sound theology, and of a piety as deep as it was unpretentious—such were the qualities of one who towers above all other masters of music in moral grandeur.',\n",
       " \"Four, perhaps only three, contemporary portraits of Bach are known.  One is in the[pg 47]possession of the firm of Peters at Leipzig and once belonged to Carl Philipp Emmanuel's daughter, who with inherited impiety sold it to a Leipzig flute player.  The second hung in St. Thomas' School and is reproduced at p. 48 of this volume.  It was painted in 1746 and restored in 1913.  Both portraits are by Elias Gottlieb Haussmann, Court Painter at Dresden.  The third portrait belonged to Bach's last pupil, Kittel, and used to hang on the Organ at Erfurt, whence it disappeared after 1809, during the Napoleonic wars.  Recently Professor Fritz Volbach of Mainz has discovered a fourth portrait, which is printed at p. 92 of the present volume.  He supposes it to be none other than the Erfurt portrait, as indeed it well may be, since it represents a man of some sixty years, austere in countenance, but of a dignity that is not so apparent in Haussmann's portraiture.116\",\n",
       " \"Bach left no will.  In consequence his widow, Anna Magdalena, burdened with the charge of a step-daughter and two daughters, was entitled to only one-third of her husband's estate.  Neither[pg 48]Carl Philipp Emmanuel nor Wilhelm Friedemann was her own child.  But the fact cannot excuse gross neglect of their father's widow.  Her own sons were in a position to make such a contribution to her income as would at least have kept want from her door.  In fact she was permitted to become dependent on public charity, and died, an alms-woman, on February 27, 1760, nearly ten years after her great husband.  The three daughters survived her.  One died in 1774, the second in 1781.  The third, Regine Susanna, survived them, her want relieved by gifts from a public that at last was awakening to the grandeur of her father.  Beethoven contributed generously.  Regine Susanna died in December 1809, the last of Bach's children.  In 1845 her nephew, Johann Christoph Friedrich's son, also died.  With him the line of Johann Sebastian Bach expired.\",\n",
       " \"As a Clavier player Bach was admired by all who had the good fortune to hear him and was the envy of the virtuosi of his day.  His method greatly differed from that of his contemporaries and predecessors, but so far no one has attempted to explain in what the difference consisted.  The same piece of music played by ten different performers equally intelligent and competent will produce a different effect in each case.  Each player will emphasise this or that detail.  This or that note will stand out with differing emphasis, and the general effect will vary consequently.  And yet, if all the players are equally competent, ought not their performances to be uniform?  The fact that they are not so is due to difference of touch, a quality which to the Clavier stands as enunciation to human speech.  Distinctness is essential for the enunciation of vowels and consonants, and not less so for the articulation of a musical phrase.  But there are gradations of distinctness.  If a sound is emitted indistinctly it is comprehensible only[pg 50]with effort, which occasions us to lose much of the pleasure we should otherwise experience.  On the other hand, over-emphasis of words or notes is to be avoided.  Otherwise the hearer's attention will be diverted from the tout ensemble.  To permit the general effect to be appreciated every note and every vowel must be sounded with balanced distinctness.\",\n",
       " \"I have often wondered why Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach's Essay on the Right Manner of playing the Clavier117does not elucidate the qualities that constitute a good touch.  For he possessed in high degree the technique that made his father pre-eminent as a player.  True, in his chapter on “Style in Performance,” he writes,“Some persons play as if their fingers were glued together; their touch is so deliberate, and they keep the keys down too long; while others, attempting to avoid this defect, play too crisply, as if the keys burnt their fingers.  The right method lies between the two extremes.” But it would have been more useful had he told us how to reach this middle path.  As he has not done so, I must try to make the matter as clear as is possible in words.\",\n",
       " \"Bach placed his hand on the finger-board so that his fingers were bent and their extremities poised perpendicularly over the keys in a plane[pg 51]parallel to them.118Consequently none of his fingers was remote from the note it was intended to strike, and was ready instantly to execute every command.  Observe the consequences of this position.  First of all, the fingers cannot fall or (as so often happens) be thrown upon the notes, but are placed upon them in full control of the force they may be called on to exert.  In the second place, since the force communicated to the note needs to be maintained with uniform pressure, the finger should not be released perpendicularly from the key, but can be withdrawn gently and gradually towards the palm of the hand.  In the third place, when passing from one note to another, a sliding action instinctively instructs the next finger regarding the amount of force exerted by its predecessor, so that the tone is equally regulated and the notes are equally distinct.  In other words, the touch is neither too long nor too short, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel complains, but is just what it ought to be.119Many advantages arise from holding the hand in Bach's position and from adopting his touch,[pg 52]on the Clavichord and Harpsichord,120and on  the Organ as well.  I point out merely the most important of them.   To begin with, if the fingers are bent, their movements are free.  The notes are struck without effort and with less risk of missing or hitting too hard, a frequent fault with people who play with their fingers elongated or insufficiently bent.  In the second place, the sliding finger-tip, and the consequently rapid transmission of regulated force from one finger to another, tend to bring out each note clearly and to make every passage sound uniformly brilliant and distinct to the hearer without exertion.  In the third place, stroking the note with uniform pressure permits the string to vibrate freely, improves and prolongs the tone, and though the Clavichord is poor in quality, allows the player to sustain long notes upon it.  And the method has this advantage: it prevents over-expenditure of strength and excessive movement of the hand.  We gather that the action of Bach's fingers was so slight as to be barely perceptible.  Only the top joint seemed to move.  His hand preserved its rounded shape even in the most intricate passages.  His fingers rested closely upon the keys, very much in the position required for a “shake.”  An unemployed finger remained in a[pg 53]position of repose.  It is hardly necessary to say thatthat other limbs of his body took no part in his performance, as is the case with many whose hands lack the requisite agility.121\",\n",
       " 'A man may possess all these qualities, however, and remain an indifferent performer on the Clavier, just as clear and agreeable enunciation does not necessarily make a good speaker.  To be a first-rate performer many other qualities are needed, and Bach possessed them all in a notable degree.',\n",
       " 'Some fingers are longer and stronger than others. Hence players are frequently seduced to use the stronger whenever they can readily do so.  Consequently successive notes become unequal in tone, and passages which leave no choice as to the finger to be used may become impossible to play.  Bach recognised this fact very early in his career.  To get over the difficulty he invented exercises for his own use in which the fingers of both hands were made to practise passages in every conceivable position.  By this means every finger on both hands equally became strong and serviceable,[pg 54] so that he could play a rapid succession of chords, single and double “shakes,” and running passages with the utmost finish and delicacy, and was equally fluent in passages where some fingers play a “shake” while the others on the same hand continue the melody.',\n",
       " \"Besides these improvements, Bach invented a new system of fingering.122 Before his time, and even in his early years, it was usual for the player to pay attention to harmony rather than counterpoint. Even so it was not customary to use every one of the twenty-four major and minor keys.  The Clavichord was still what we term“gebunden”; that is, several keys struck the same string, which, therefore, could not be accurately tuned.123 Consequently it was usual to employ only those keys whose notes were tuned with some approximation to accuracy.  Again,[pg 56]good players in those days hardly ever used the thumb, except when a large interval had to be stretched.  But when Bach began to melodise harmony so that his middle parts not merely filled in but had a tune of their own, when, too, he began to deviate from the Church modes then in general vogue in secular music, using the diatonic and chromatic scales indifferently, and tuning the Clavier in all the twenty-four keys, he found himself compelled to introduce a system of fingering better adapted to his innovations than that in use, and in particular, to challenge the convention which condemned the thumb to inactivity. It is held by some writers that Couperin forestalled Bach's method of fingering, in hisL'Art de toucher le Clavecin, published in 1716.  But that is not the case.  In the first place, Bach was above thirty years old in 1716, and had already developed a distinctive method of his own.  And in the second place, Couperin's system differs materially from Bach's, though both made more frequent use of the thumb than was so far customary.  When I say “more frequent use” I do so advisedly; for whereas in Bach's system the thumb is the principal finger—for the difficult keys, as they are called, are unplayable without it—it is not equally indispensable with Couperin, whose thematic material was not so intricate as Bach's, nor did he compose or play in such difficult keys.  Consequently Couperin[pg 56]had not an equally urgent need to use the thumb.  We need only compare Couperin's with Bach's system of fingering, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel explains it,124 to discover that Bach's permits every passage, however intricate and polyphonic, to be played with ease, whereas Couperin's is hardly effective even for his own compositions.  Bach was acquainted with Couperin's works and highly esteemed them,125 as he did those of other French Clavier composers, for their finish and brilliance.  But he considered them affected in their excessive use of ornaments, scarcely a single note being free from them.  He held them, also, superficial in matter.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's easy, unconstrained use of the fingers, his musical touch, the clearness and precision of every note he struck, the resourcefulness of his fingering, his thorough training of every finger of both hands, the luxuriance of his thematic material and his original method of stating it, all contributed to give him almost unlimited power over his instrument, so easily did he surmount the difficulties of its keyboard.  Whether he improvised or played his compositions from notes, he systematically employed every finger of each hand, and his fingering was as uncommon as the compositions themselves, yet so accurate that he [pg 57]never missed a note.  Moreover, he read at sight other people's compositions (which, to be sure, were much easier than his own) with the utmost facility.  Indeed, he once boasted to a friend at Weimar that he could play at sight and without a mistake anything put before him.  But he was mistaken, as his friend convinced him before the week was out.  Having invited Bach to breakfast one morning, he placed on the Clavier, among other music, a piece which, at a first glance, seemed perfectly easy.  On his arrival, Bach, as was his custom, sat down at the Clavier to play or look through the music.  Meanwhile his friend was in the next room preparing breakfast.  In a short time Bach took up the piece of music destined to change his opinion and began to play it.  He had not proceeded far before he came to a passage at which he stopped.  After a look at it he began again, only to stop at the same place. “No,” he called out to his friend, who was laughing heartily in the next room, “the man does not exist who can play everything at sight.  It can't be done.”With that he got up from the Clavier in some annoyance.126\",\n",
       " 'Bach also could read scores with remarkable facility and play them on the Clavier. He found no more difficulty in piecing together the[pg 58]separate parts when laid side by side before him.127He often did so when a friend brought him a new Trio or Quartet for Strings and wished to hear how it sounded.  If a Continuo part, however badly figured, was put before him he could improvise a Trio or Quartet upon it.  Nay, when he was in the mood and at the height of his powers, he would convert a Trio into a Quartet by extemporising a fourth part.  On such occasions he used a Harpsichord with two manuals and pedal attachment.',\n",
       " 'Bach preferred the Clavichord to the Harpsichord, which, though susceptible of great variety of tone, seemed to him lacking in soul.  The Pianoforte was still in its infancy and too coarse.128[pg 59]Both for practice and intimate use he regarded the Clavichord as the best instrument and preferred to express on it his finest thoughts.  He held the Harpsichord, or Clavicembalo, incapable of the gradations of tone obtainable on the Clavichord, an instrument which, though feeble in quality, is extremely flexible.',\n",
       " \"No one could adjust the quill plectrums of his Harpsichord to Bach's satisfaction; he always did it himself.  He tuned his Harpsichord and Clavichord, and was so skilful in the operation that it never took him more than a quarter of an hour.  It enabled him to play in any key he preferred, and placed the whole twenty-four of them at his disposal, so that he could modulate into the remoter as easily and naturally as into the more nearly related keys.  Those who heard him frequently could hardly detect the fact that he had modulated into a distant key, so smooth were his transitions.  In chromatic movements his modulation was as easy and sequent as in diatonic.  His Chromatic Fantasia, which is now published,129 bears out my statement.  In his extemporisation he was even freer, more brilliant and expressive. \",\n",
       " 'When he played his own music Bach usually adopted a brisk pace.  He contrived to introduce so much variety that every piece became a sort of conversation between its parts.  If he wished to express deep emotion he did not strike the notes with great force, as many do, but expressed his feeling in simple melodic and harmonic figures,130relying rather on the internal resources of his art than external dynamics.  Therein he was right.  True emotion is not suggested by hammering the Clavier. All that results is that the notes cannot be heard distinctly, much less be connected coherently. ',\n",
       " \"What has been said regarding Bach's admirable Clavier playing applies generally to his skill as an organist.  The Clavier and Organ have points in common, but in style and touch are as different as their respective uses.  What sounds well on the Clavier is ineffective on the Organ, and vice versa.  The most accomplished Clavier player may be, and usually is, a bad organist unless he realises the differing natures of the two instruments and the uses they serve.  I have come across only two men who can be regarded as exceptions to this general rule—Bach and his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann.  Both were finished Clavier performers, but no trace of the Clavier style was apparent when they played the Organ.  Melody, harmony, and pace were carefully selected with due regard to the nature and distinctive use of each instrument.  When Wilhelm Friedemann played the Clavier his touch was elegant, delicate, agreeable.  When he played the Organ he inspired a feeling of reverent awe. On the one he was[pg 62]charming.  On the other he was solemn, impressive.  So also was his father, and to an even greater degree.  Wilhelm Friedemann was a mere child to him as an organist, and frankly admitted the fact.131 The music that extraordinary man wrote for the Organ is full of dignity, awe-inspiring, saturated with the atmosphere of devotion.  His improvisation was even more inspired, dignified, and impressive: for then his imagination was untrammelled by the irksomeness of expressing himself on paper.  What is the essence of this art? Let me, though imperfectly, attempt an answer.\",\n",
       " \"When we compare Bach's Clavier compositions with those written for the Organ it is at once apparent that they differ essentially in melodic and harmonic structure.  Hence we conclude that a good organist must select fitting themes for his instrument, and let himself be guided by its character and that of the place in which it stands and by the objects of its use.  Its great body of tone renders the Organ ill-adapted to light and jaunty music.  Its echoes must have liberty to rise and fall in the dim spaces of the church, otherwise the sound becomes confused, blurred, and unintelligible.  What is played upon it[pg 63]must be suited to the place and the instrument, in other words, must be congruous to a solemn and majestic fabric.  Occasionally and exceptionally a solo stop may be used in a Trio, etc.  But the proper function of the Organ is to support church singing and to stimulate devotional feeling.  The composer therefore must not write music for it which is congruous to secular surroundings.  What is commonplace and trite can neither impress the hearer nor excite devotional feeling.  It must therefore be banished from the Organ-loft. How clearly Bach grasped that fact!  Even his secular music disdained trivialities.  Much more so his Organ music, in which he seems to soar as a spirit above this mortal planet.\",\n",
       " \"Of the means by which Bach attained to such an altitude as a composer for the Organ we may notice his harmonic treatment of the old Church modes, his use of the obbligato pedal, and his original registration.  The remoteness of the ecclesiastical modes from our twenty-four major and minor keys renders them particularly appropriate to the service of religion.  Any one who looks at Bach's simple four-part Hymn tunes (Choralgesänge) will at once convince himself of the fact.  But no one can realise how the Organ sounds under a similar system of harmonic treatment unless he has heard it.  It becomes a choir of four or five parts, each in its natural[pg 64]compass.  Compare the following chords in divided harmony:\",\n",
       " 'with these:',\n",
       " 'which is the more usual form organists employ.  We realise instantly the effect when music in four or more parts is played in the same manner.  Bach always played the Organ so, adding the obbligato pedal, which few organists know how to use properly.  He employed it not only to sound the low notes which organists usually play with the left hand, but he gave it a regular part of its own, often so complicated that many organists would find it difficult to play with their five fingers.',\n",
       " 'To these qualities must be added the exquisite art Bach displayed in combining the stops of the Organ.  His registration frequently astonished organists and Organ builders, who ridiculed it at first, but were obliged in the end to admit its[pg 65]admirable results and to confess that the Organ gained in richness and sonority.132',\n",
       " \"Bach's peculiar registration was based on his intimate knowledge of Organ building and of the properties of each individual stop.  Very early in his career he made a point of giving to each part of the Organ the utterance best suited to its qualities, and this led him to seek unusual combinations of stops which otherwise would not have occurred to him.  Nothing escaped his notice which had the slightest bearing on his art or promised to advance it.  For instance, he made a point of observing the effect of large musical compositions in different surroundings.  The practised ear, which enabled him to detect the slightest error in music even of the fullest and richest texture, and the art and rapidity with which he tuned his instrument, alike attest his intuitive skill and many-sidedness.  When he was at Berlin in 1747 he was shown the new Opera House.  He took in its good and bad qualities at a glance, whereas others had done so only after experience.  He was shown the large adjoining Saloon and went up into the gallery that runs round it.  Merely glancing at the roof he remarked, “The architect has secured a novel effect which, probably, neither himself nor any one else suspected.”  The Saloon, in fact, is a parallelogram. If a [pg 66]person puts his face to the wall in one corner of it and whispers a few words, another person at the corner diagonally opposite can hear them distinctly, though to others between them the words are inaudible.  The effect arises from the span of the arches in the roof, as Bach saw at a glance.  These and similar observations suggested to him striking and unusual combinations of Organ stops.\",\n",
       " ' Bach brought the methods I have indicated to bear upon Church music, and they help to explain his extraordinarily dignified and inspired playing, which was at once so appropriate and filled the listener with deep awe and admiration.  His profound knowledge of harmony, unfailing originality, freedom from a secular style, his complete command of the instrument, both manuals and pedals, whence flowed a generous stream of the richest and most abundant fancy, the infallible and swift judgment which allowed him always to select from the treasury of his mind precisely the musical ideas best suited to the occasion immediately before him, his intuitive grasp of every detail, and his power to make it serve his artistic ends—in a word, his transcendent genius brought the art of Organ playing to a degree of perfection which, till then, it had never attained and hardly will attain again.  Quantz133has expressed the [pg 67]same opinion. “The admirable Johann Sebastian Bach,” he writes, “brought the art of Organ playing to its highest perfection.  It is to be hoped that when he dies it will not be suffered to decline or be lost, as is to be feared from the small number of people who nowadays bestow pains upon it.”134',\n",
       " 'Strangers often asked Bach to play to them between the hours of divine service.  On those occasions he was wont to select and treat a theme in various ways, making it the subject of each extemporisation even if he continued playing for two hours.  As a beginning he played a Prelude and Fugue on the Great Organ.  Then he developed it with solo stops in a Trio or Quartet.  A Hymn-tune followed, whose melody he interrupted in the subtlest fashion with fragments of the theme in three or four parts.  Last came a Fugue, with full Organ, in which he treated the subject alone or in association with one or more accessory themes.  Here we have the art which old Reinken of Hamburg considered to be lost, but which, as he afterwards found, not only survived but attained its greatest perfection in Bach.',\n",
       " \"Bach's pre-eminent position and his high reputation often caused him to be invited to examine candidates for vacant organistships, and to report on new Organs.  In both cases he acted so conscientiously and impartially that he generally made [pg 68]enemies.  Scheibe, late Director of Music at the Danish Court, who as a young man was examined by Bach on such an occasion, was so incensed by Bach's unfavourable verdict that he afterwards avenged himself in his “Critical Musician” by violently attacking his examiner.135 In his examination of Organs Bach equally exposed himself to trouble.  He could as little prevail on himself to praise a bad instrument as to recommend a bad organist.  He was, therefore, severe, though always fair, in the tests he applied, and as he was thoroughly acquainted with the construction of the instrument it was hopeless to attempt to deceive him.  First of all he drew out all the stops, to hear the Full Organ.  He used to say jokingly, that he wanted to find out whether the instrument had good lungs!  Then he gave every part of it a most searching test.  But his sense of fairness was so strong that, if he found the work really well done, and the builder's remuneration[pg 69]too small, so that he was likely to be a loser, Bach endeavoured, and often successfully, to procure for him an adequate addition to the purchase price.\",\n",
       " 'When the examination was over, especially if the instrument pleased him, Bach liked to exhibit his splendid talent, both for his own pleasure and the gratification of those who were present.  Such demonstrations of his powers invariably invited the verdict, that he was conclusively “the prince of Clavier and Organ players,” a title which Sorge, the late highly-esteemed organist at Lobenstein,136once gave him in a dedicatory Preface.',\n",
       " \"Bach's first attempts at composition, like all early efforts, were unsatisfactory.  Lacking special instruction to direct him towards his goal, he was compelled to do what he could in his own way, like others who have set out upon a career without a guide.  Most youthful composers let their fingers run riot up and down the keyboard, snatching handfuls of notes, assaulting the instrument in wild frenzy, in hope that something may result from it.  Such people are merely Finger Composers—in his riper years Bach used to call them Harpsichord Knights—that is to say, their fingers tell them what to write instead of being instructed by the brain what to play.137 Bach abandoned that method of composition when he observed that[pg 71]brilliant flourishes lead nowhere.  He realised that musical ideas need to be subordinated to a plan and that the young composer's first need is a model to instruct his efforts.  Opportunely Vivaldi's Concertos for the Violin,138 then recently published, gave him the guidance he needed.  He had often heard them praised as admirable works of art, and conceived the happy idea of arranging them for the Clavier.139 Hence he was led to study their structure, the musical ideas on which they are built, the variety of their modulations, and other characteristics.  Moreover, in adapting to the Clavier ideas and phrases originally written for the Violin Bach was compelled to put his brain to work, and so freed his inspiration from dependence on his fingers.  Henceforth he was able to draw ideas out of his own storehouse, and having placed himself on the right road, needed only perseverance and hard work to succeed.  And how persevering he was!  He even robbed[pg 72]himself of sleep to practise in the night what he had written during the day!  But the diligence he bestowed upon his own compositions did not hinder him from studying the works of Frescobaldi,140 Froberger, Kerl, Pachelbel, Fischer, Strungk,141 Buxtehude, Reinken, Bruhns, Böhm, and certain French organists who were famed in those days as masters of harmony and fugue.142\",\n",
       " \"The models he selected—Church musicians for the most part—and his own disposition inclined him to serious and exalted subjects.  But in that kind of music little can be accomplished with inadequate technique.  Bach's first object, therefore, was to develop his power of expressing himself before he attempted to realise the ideal that beckoned him.  Music to him was a language, and the composer a poet who, whatever the idiom he affects, must first of all have at his disposal the means of making himself intelligible to others.  But the technique of his period Bach found limited in variety and insufficiently pliable.  Therefore he set himself at the outset to refashion the accepted harmonic system.  He did so in a manner characteristically individual and bearing the impress of his personality.\",\n",
       " 'If the language of music is merely the utterance of a melodic line, a simple sequence of musical notes, it can justly be accused of poverty.  The addition of a Bass puts it upon a harmonic foundation and clarifies it, but defines rather than gives it added richness.  A melody so accompanied—even though all the notes are not those of the true Bass—or treated with simple embellishments in the upper parts, or with simple chords, used to be called “homophony.”  But it is a very different thing when two melodies are so interwoven that they converse together like two persons upon a footing of pleasant equality.  In the first case the accompaniment is subordinate, and serves merely to support the first or principal part.  In the second case the two parts are not similarly related.  New melodic combinations spring from their interweaving, out of which new forms of musical expression emerge.  If more parts are interwoven in the same free and independent manner, the apparatus of language is correspondingly enlarged, and becomes practically inexhaustible if, in addition, varieties of form and rhythm are introduced.  Hence harmony becomes no longer a mere accompaniment of melody, but rather a potent agency for augmenting the richness and expressiveness of musical conversation.  To serve that end a simple accompaniment will not suffice.  True harmony is the interweaving of several melodies, which[pg 74]emerge now in the upper, now in the middle, and now in the lower parts.',\n",
       " \"From about the year 1720, when he was thirty-five, until his death in 1750, Bach's harmony consists in this melodic interweaving of independent melodies, so perfect in their union that each part seems to constitute the true melody.  Herein Bach excels all the composers in the world.143 At least, I have found no one to equal him in music known to me.  Even in his four-part writing we can, not infrequently, leave out the upper and lower parts and still find the middle parts melodious and agreeable.\",\n",
       " 'But in harmony of this kind each part must be highly plastic; otherwise it cannot play its role as an actual melody and at the same time combine with the other parts.  To produce it Bach followed a course of his own, upon which the textbooks of his day were silent, but which his genius suggested to him.  Its originality consists in the freedom of his part writing, in which he transgresses, seemingly, at any rate, rules long established and to his contemporaries almost sacred.  Bach, however, realised their object, which was simply to facilitate the flow of pure melody on a sound harmonic basis, in other words, successive and coexistent euphony, and he succeeded with singular success though by[pg 75]unfamiliar means.  Let me explain my meaning more closely.',\n",
       " 'Between simple intervals there is little difficulty in deciding whether the second note must rise or fall.  And in regard to phrases, or sections of a phrase, if we analyse their structure and follow out their harmonic tendency, their resolution is equally clear.  But this sense of destination may be provoked in each part by different intervals.  As we have observed already, every one of the four parts must flow melodically and freely.  But to secure that result it will be necessary to introduce between the notes which begin a phrase and establish its general atmosphere other notes which often are not consonant with those employed in the other parts and whose incidence is governed by the accent.  This is what we call a transitus regularis et irregularis.144 Each part starts from a fixed point, and returns to it, but travels freely between them.  No one has made more use of such progressions than Bach in order to colour his parts and give them a characteristic melodic line.  Hence, unless his music is played with perfect fluency, occasional passages will sound harshly and we may be tempted to accuse him of exaggeration.  But the charge is ill founded. Once we play them as Bach intended [pg 76 ]them, such passages reveal their full beauty and their attractive though bizarre dissonance opens up new vistas in the realm of sound.',\n",
       " \"But, to speak in detail of Bach's transgression of recognised rules.  To begin with, he admitted octaves and fifths provided they sounded well; that is, when the cause of their being forbidden did not arise.145 Everybody knows that there are positions in which they sound well, and others when they should be avoided, owing to the harsh effect or thin harmony they produce.  Bach's octaves and fifths never produce bad or thin harmony, and he was very definite as to when they could and could not be used.  In certain circumstances he would not permit hidden fifths and octaves even between the middle parts, though we exclude them only between the outer parts.  Yet, on occasion he used them in such a barefaced manner as to puzzle the beginner in composition.  But their use very soon commends itself.  Even in the last revision of his early compositions we find him altering passages, which at first sight appear impeccable, with the object of enriching their harmony and without scrupling to use hidden octaves.  A remarkable instance occurs[pg 77]in the first part of the Well-tempered Clavier, in the E major Fugue, between the fifth and fourth bars from the end.146 I regret to this hour that, on looking over the later text, from which Hoffmeister and Kühnel's edition of that work is printed,147 I was so foolish as to reject Bach's amended reading there, merely because the harmony is unorthodox though more pleasing.  I stupidly preferred the older, more correct, and harsher reading, though in the later text the three parts run easily and smoothly. And what more can one demand? \",\n",
       " 'Again, there is a rule that every note raised by an accidental cannot be doubled in the chord, because the raised note must, from its nature, resolve on the note above.  If it is doubled, it must rise doubled in both parts and, consequently, form consecutive octaves.  Such is the rule.  But Bach frequently doubles not only notes accidentally raised elsewhere in the scale but actually the semitonium modi or leading-note itself.  Yet he avoids consecutive octaves.  His finest works yield examples of this.',\n",
       " \"Again, Bach's statement that “over a pedal point all intervals are permissible that occur in the three scales”148 should be regarded rather[pg 78]an expansion than a violation of the recognised rule.  In general what is called an Organ point is merely a retarded close.  Bach, however, did not hesitate to employ it in the middle of a piece; a striking example occurs in the last Gigue of the English Suites.149 On a first hearing this Gigue, imperfectly rendered, may not sound well.  But it grows more beautiful as it becomes more familiar, and what seemed harsh is found to be smooth and agreeable, until one never tires of playing and hearing it.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's modulation was as original and characteristic as his harmony, and as closely related to it.  But the two things, though closely associated, are not the same.  By harmony we mean the concordance of several parts; by modulation, their progression through keys.  Modulation can take place in a single part.  Harmony requires more than one.  I will endeavour to make my meaning clearer.\",\n",
       " ' Most composers stick closely to their tonic key and modulate out of it with deliberation.  In music that requires a large number of performers, and in a building, for instance a church, where the large volume of sound dies away slowly, such a habit shows good sense in the composer who wishes his work to produce the best possible effect.  But in chamber or instrumental music it is not always a proof of wisdom, but rather of mental poverty. Bach saw clearly that the two [pg 79]styles demand different treatment.  In his largechoral compositions he bridles his exuberant fancy.  In his instrumental works he lets himself go.  As he never courted popularity, but always pursued his ideal, Bach had no reason to suppress the nobility of his inspirations, or to lower their standard for public consumption.  Nor did he ever do so.  Therefore every modulation in his instrumental work is a new thought, a constantly progressive creation in the plane of the chosen keys and those related to them.  He holds fast to the essentials of harmony, but with every modulation introduces a new suggestion and glides so smoothly to the end of a piece that no creaking of machinery is perceptible; yet no single bar—I might almost say no part of a bar—islike another.  Every modulation bears a strict relationship to the key from which it proceeds, and springs naturally from it.  Bach ignored, or rather despised, the sudden sallies by which many composers seek to surprise their hearers.  Even in his chromatic passages his progressions are so smooth and easy that we are hardly conscious of them, however extreme they may be.  He makes us feel that he has not stepped outside the diatonic scale, so quick is he to seize upon the consonances common to dissonant systems and combine them to his sure purpose.',\n",
       " \"Bach's treatment of harmony and modulation powerfully influenced his melody.  The strands of his harmony are really concurrent melodies.  They flow easily and expressively, never engross the hearer's attention, but divide his interest, as now one now the other becomes prominent.  Even when they are noticeable they seem obscured by the melodic parts that accompany them—I say “seem obscured,” for if the hearer is sufficiently instructed to distinguish the several melodies in the ensemble he will discover them to be more clearly defined by their accompaniment.\",\n",
       " \"The combination of several melodic lines obliges the composer to use devices which are unnecessary in homophonic music.  A single melody can develop as it pleases.  But when two or more are combined each must be so delicately and cleverly fashioned that it can be interwoven with the others in this direction and in that.  And here we detect one at least of the reasons why Bach's melodies are so strangely original, and his tunes so clearly distinguishable from those of other[pg 81]composers.  Provided that novelty does not degenerate into eccentricity or extravagance, and that clearness and facility of expression march with agreeableness, a composer's meritoriousnessis proclaimed in his originality.150 The one drawback is that the ordinary hearer cannot appreciate melodic beauties which are patent only to the expert.\",\n",
       " \"But Bach's melodies are not invariably so handicapped.  They are always original, it is true.  But in his free compositions the melodies are so natural and spontaneous that, while they sound differently from those of other composers, their naturalness, and the sincerity of feeling that inspires them, make them intelligible to every listener.  Most of the Preludes in the Well-tempered Clavier as well as a number of movements in the Suites are of this character.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's melody, then, bears the unmistakable stamp of originality.  And so does his passage work, as it is called.  Such novelty, originality, and brilliancy are not found in any other composer.  Examples are to be found in all Bach's Clavier works. But the most striking and original are in[pg 82]the Great Variations,151 in the first Part of the Clavierübung,152 in the English Suites,153 and the Chromatic Fantasia.154 In the last particularly Bach's fertility impresses us.  The greater part of its passage work is in the form of harmonic arpeggios whose richness and originality match the chords they represent.\",\n",
       " \"In order to realise the care and skill Bach expended on his melody and harmony, and how he put the very best of his genius into his work, I need only instance his efforts to construct a composition incapable of being harmonised with another melodic part.  In his day it was regarded as imperative to perfect the harmonic structure of part-writing.  Consequently the composer was careful to complete his chords and leave no door open for another part.  So far the rule had been followed more or less closely in music for two, three, and four parts, and Bach observed it in such cases.  But he applied it also to compositions consisting of a single part, and to a deliberate experiment in this form we owe the six Violin and the six Violoncello Solo Suites,155[pg 83]which have no accompaniment and do not require one.  So remarkable is Bach's skill that the solo instrument actually produces all the notes required for complete harmony, rendering a second part unnecessary and even impossible.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's melody never palls on us, because of the presence in it of those qualities to which I have referred.  It remains “ever fair and young,”like Nature herself.  In his earlier works, in which we find him still in bondage to the prevailing mode, there is a good deal that to-day seems antiquated.  But when, as in his later works, he draws his melody from the living wells of inspiration and cuts himself adrift from convention, all is as fresh and new as if it had been written yesterday.  Of how many compositions of that period can the same be said?  Even the works of ingenious composers like Reinhard Keiser156 and Handel have become old-fashioned sooner than we or their composers might have supposed.  Like other caterers for the public, they were obliged to pander to its taste, and such music endures no longer than the standard which produced it.  Nothing is more inconstant and fickle than popular caprice and, in general, what is called fashion.  It must be admitted, however, that Handel's Fugues are not yet out of date,[pg 84]though there are probably few of his Arias that we now find agreeable.157\",\n",
       " \"Bach's melody and harmony are rendered still more distinctive by their inexhaustible rhythmic variety.  Hitherto we have discussed his music merely subjectively as harmony and melody.  But to display vivacity and variety music needs to be uttered with rhythmic point and vigour.  More than those of any other period composers of Bach's time found no difficulty in this, for they acquired facility in the management of rhythm in the“Suite,” which held the place of our “Sonata.” Between the initial Prelude and closing Gigue the Suite includes a number of characteristic French dance measures, whose rhythm is their distinguishing characteristic.  Composers of Bach's day, therefore, were familiar with measures and rhythms which are now obsolete.  Moreover skilful treatment was necessary in order that each dance might exhibit its own distinctive character and swing.  Herein Bach exceeded his predecessors and contemporaries.  He experimented with every kind of key and rhythm in order to give variety and colour to each movement.  Out of his experience he acquired such facility that, even in[pg 85]Fugue, with its complex interweaving of several parts, he was able to employ a rhythm as easy as it was striking, as characteristic as it was sustained from beginning to end, as natural as a simple Minuet.\",\n",
       " \"The source of Bach's astonishing pre-eminence is to be sought in his facile and constant application of the methods we have discussed.  In whatever form he chose to express himself, easy or difficult, he was successful and seemingly effortless.158There is not a note in his music that does not suggest consummate ease of workmanship. What he sets out to do he concludes triumphantly.  The result is complete and perfect; no one could wish for a single note to be other than it is.  Some illustrations will make my point clearer.\",\n",
       " \"Carl Philipp Emmanuel, in the preface to his father's Vierstimmige Choralgesänge(“Four-part Hymn-tunes”), which he edited,159 says that [pg 86]the world was accustomed to look for nothing but masterpieces from Bach.  Some reviewers thought this praise exaggerated.  But if the term “masterpiece” is restricted to works written during the years of Bach's maturity160 it is nothing less than the truth.  Others have produced masterpieces in various forms which may be placed honourably by the side of his.  For instance, certain Allemandes, Courantes, etc., by Handel and others are not less beautiful, though less richly wrought, than Bach's.  But in Fugue, Counterpoint, and Canon he stands alone, in a grandeur so isolated that all around him seems desert and void.  No one ever wrote Fugues to compare with his; indeed, persons unacquainted with them cannot imagine what a Fugue is and ought to be.  The ordinary Fugue follows a rule of thumb development.  It takes a theme, puts another beside it, passes them into related keys, and writes other parts round them over a Continuo.  Certainly this is Fugue: but of what merit?  Persons who know no other not unnaturally hold the whole species in little esteem, and the player who hopes to make such commonplace material convincing will need all his skill and imagination.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's Fugue is of quite another kind.  It presents all the characteristics we are accustomed to [pg 87]in freer musical forms: a flowing and distinctive melody, ease, clarity, and facility in the progression of the parts, inexhaustible variety of modulation, purest harmony, the exclusion of every jarring or unnecessary note, unity of form and variety of style, rhythm, and measure, and such superabundant animation that the hearer may well ask himself whether every note is not actually alive.  Such are the properties of Bach's Fugues, properties which excite the admiration and astonishment of all who can appreciate the intellectual calibre their composition demands.  How great a tribute of homage is due to work of this kind, which exhibits all the qualities which lend distinction to compositions in other musical forms!  Moreover, while all Bach's Fugues of his mature period have the foregoing properties in common, each is endowed with peculiar excellencies of its own, has its own distinctive individuality, and displays a melodic and harmonic scheme in keeping with it.  The man who can play one of Bach's Fugues is familiar with, and can play, one only; whereas knowing one, we can perform portfolios of Fugues by other performers of Bach's period.\",\n",
       " \" To what a height was the art of Counterpoint carried by Bach's genius!  It enabled him to develop out of a given subject a whole family of related and contrasted themes, of every form and design.  It taught him to develop an idea logically[pg 88]from the beginning to the end.  It gave him such a command of harmony and its infinite combinations that he could invert whole themes, note by note, in every part, without impairing in the least the flow of melody or purity of his harmony.  It taught him to write in canon at all intervals and in movements of all kinds so easily and naturally that the workmanship is not perceptible and the composition sounds as smoothly as though it were in the free style. Lastly, it has given to posterity a legacy of works immensely various, which are, and will remain, models of contrapuntal form as long as music endures.161\",\n",
       " \"I have written exclusively so far of Bach's Clavier and Organ work.  But in its expression music has two branches, instrumental and vocal, and as Bach excels in both of them, the reader will desire to hear somewhat respecting his vocal writings.\",\n",
       " 'It was at Weimar that Bach first had occasion to write for the voice,162 upon his appointment to[pg 89]the Kapelle, which imposed on him the provision of music for the ducal chapel.  His church music, like his Organ works, is devout and serious, and in every respect what church music ought to be.  He makes a point also of not elaborating individual words, which leads to mere trifling, but interprets the text as a whole.163 His choruses invariably are magnificent and impressive, and he frequently introduces Chorals into them,164 making the other parts accompany their Cantus fugally, as was the practice in a Motet.  As elsewhere in his works, the harmonic structure of his voice parts and instrumental accompaniment is rich.  The declamation of the recitatives is expressive, and the latter have fine Continuo parts.165 In his Arias, hardly one of which is not beautiful and expressive, Bach seems to have been handicapped by the inefficiency of his singers and instrumentalists, who constantly complained of the difficulty of his music.  If he had been fortunate enough to have capable performers the merits of his church music[pg 90]would have been established and, like his other works, they would still be sung and admired; for they contain treasures which deserve immortality.166',\n",
       " \" Among the works composed at Leipzig I single out two Cantatas, one of which was performed at Cöthen at the funeral of Bach's beloved Prince Leopold, and the other in St. Paul's Church, Leipzig, on the occasion of the funeral sermon in honour of Christiana Eberhardine, Queen of Poland and Electress of Saxony.167 The first contains double choruses of uncommon magnificence and most affecting sentiment.168 The second has only four-part choruses, but they are so delightful and fresh that he who begins the work will not pause till he has reached the end of it. It was written in October 1727.\",\n",
       " \"Bach also composed a great number of Cantatas, chiefly for the choir of St. Thomas' School, Leipzig.169[pg 91]The choir ordinarily numbered fifty singers, andsometimes more, over whose musical training Bach presided like a father.  He practised them so hard in Cantatas for single and double chorus that they became excellent singers.  Among these works are some which, in profundity of conception, magnificence, richness of harmony and melody, and animation, surpass everything of their kind.  But, like all Bach's works, and in common with other masterpieces, they are difficult to perform and need a numerous orchestra to produce their full effect.\",\n",
       " \"Such are Bach's most important vocal compositions.170 In minor forms of the art, morceaux for social entertainments and the like, he wrote little,171 though he was of a most sociable disposition. For instance, he is said never to have composed a song.172 And why should he?  They produce themselves so spontaneously that there is little call for genius to aid their gestation.\",\n",
       " 'It not infrequently happens that talented composers and players are incapable of imparting their skill to others.  Either they have never troubled to probe the mechanism of their own facility, or, through the excellence of their instructors, have taken the short cut to proficiency and allowed their teacher and not their own judgment to decide how a thing should be done.  Such people are useless to instruct beginners.  True, they may succeed in teaching the rudiments of technique, assuming that they have been properly taught themselves.  But they are certainly unqualified to teach in the full sense of the word.  There is, in fact, only one way to become a good teacher, and that is to have gone through the discipline of self-instruction, a path along which the beginner may go astray a thousand times before attaining to perfection. For it is just this stumbling effort that reveals the dimensions of the art. The man who has adventured it learns the obstacles that obstruct his path, and how to surmount them. To be sure, it is a lengthy method. But if a man[pg 93]has patience to persevere he will reap a sure reward after an alluring pilgrimage.  No musician ever founded a school of his own who has not followed such a course, and to his experience his teaching has owed its distinctive character.',\n",
       " 'This is so with Bach, who, only gradually discovering his full stature, was thirty years old before unremitting application raised him above the difficulties of his art.  But he reaped his reward.  Self-discipline set him on the fairest and most alluring path that it has ever been given to a musician to tread.',\n",
       " 'To teach well a man needs to have a full mind.  He must have discovered how to meet and have overcome the obstacles in his own path before he can be successful in teaching others how to avoid them.  Bach united both qualities.  Hence, as a teacher he was the most instructive, clear, and definite that has ever been.  In every branch of his art he produced a band of pupils who followed in his footsteps, without, however, equalling his achievement.',\n",
       " 'First of all let me show how he taught the Clavier.173 To begin with, his pupils were made to acquire the special touch of which I have already spoken.174To that end for months together he made them practise nothing but simple exercises[pg 94]for the fingers of both hands, at the same time emphasising the need for clearness and distinctness.  He kept them at these exercises for from six to twelve months, unless he found his pupils losing heart, in which case he so far met them as to write short studies which incorporated a particular exercise.  Of this kind are the Six Little Preludes for Beginners,175 and the FifteenTwo-part Inventions,176 both of which Bach wrote during the lesson for a particular pupil and afterwards improved into beautiful and expressive compositions.  Besides this finger practice, either in regular exercises or in pieces composed for the purpose, Bach introduced his pupils to the use of the various ornaments in both hands. ',\n",
       " \"Not until this stage was reached did Bach allow his pupils to practise his own larger works, so admirably calculated, as he knew, to develop their powers.  In order to lessen their difficulty, it was his excellent habit to play over to them the pieces they were to study, with the remark,“That's how it ought to sound.”177 It would be difficult to exaggerate the helpfulness of this method. The pupil's interest was roused by hearing the piece properly played. But that was not [pg 95]the sole result.  Without the help thus given the pupil could only hope to overcome the difficulties of the piece after considerable effort, and would find it much less easy to realise a proper rendering of it.  As it was, he received at once an ideal to aim at and was taught how to surmount the difficulties the piece presented.  Many a young performer, still imperfect after a year's practice, probably would master his music in a month if he once had it played over to him.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's method of teaching composition was equally sure and effective.178 He did not begin with the dry details of counterpoint, as was the custom of other teachers in his day.  Still less did he burden his pupils with the physical properties of sound, which he held to be matter for the theorist and instrument-maker rather than the composer.  He started them off at once on four-part harmony over a figured Bass, making his pupils write each part on a separate stave in order to impress on them the need for accurate harmonic progression.  Then he passed to Hymn tunes, setting the Bass himself and making his pupils write the Tenor and Alto parts.  In time he let them write the Bass also.  He insisted on correct harmony and on each part having a real melodic line.  Every musician knows what models[pg 96]Bach has left us in this form.  The inner parts of his four-part Hymn-tunes are so smooth and melodious that often they might be taken for the melody.  He made his pupils aim at similar tunefulness, and until they showed a high standard of merit did not permit them to write compositions of their own.  Meanwhile he aimed at cultivating their feeling for pure harmony and for the order and connection of ideas and parts by familiarising them with the compositions of others.  Until they had acquired facility in those qualities he neither permitted them nor held them competent to put pen to paper.\",\n",
       " \"Bach required his pupils in composition to work out their musical ideas mentally.  If any of them lacked this faculty he admonished him not to compose and discountenanced even his sons from attempting to write until they had first given evidence of genuine musical gifts.  Having completed their elementary study of harmony, Bach took his pupils on to the theory of Fugue, beginning with two-part writing.  In these and other exercises he insisted on the pupil composing away from the Clavier.179 Those who did otherwise he ridiculed as “Harpsichord Knights.”  In the second place he required rigorous attention to each part and its relation to the concurrent parts, permitting none, not even an inner one, to break off before it had finished what it had to say.  He insisted upon a correct relation between each note and its predecessor.  If he came upon one whose derivation or destination was not perfectly clear he struck it out as faulty.  It is, indeed, a meticulous exactitude in each individual part that makes [pg 98]Bach's harmony really multiple melody.  Confused part-writing, where a note that belongs to the Tenor is given to the Alto, or vice versa, or the haphazard addition of extraneous parts to a chord which suddenly shows an increase of notes as if fallen from the sky, to vanish as suddenly as they came, are faults found neither in his own nor his pupils' writing.  He regarded his musical parts as so many persons engaged in conversation.  If there are three, each of them on occasion may be silent and listen to the others until it finds something relevant to say itself.  But if, at an interesting point of the conversation, an interloping voice intervened, Bach regarded it as an intruder and let his pupils understand that it could not be admitted.\",\n",
       " \"Notwithstanding his strictness on this point, Bach allowed his pupils considerable licence in other respects.  In their use of certain intervals, as in their treatment of harmony and melody, he let them experiment within the limits of their ability, taking care to discountenance ugliness and to insist on their giving appropriate expression to the character of the composition.  Beauty of expression, he postulated, was only attainable on a foundation of pure and accurate harmony.  Having experimented in every form himself, he liked to see his pupils equally adventurous. Earlier teachers of composition, for instance, Berardi,180[pg 99] Buononcini,181and Fux,182 did not allow such liberty.  They were afraid to trust their pupils to encounter difficulties, and short-sightedly prevented them from learning how to overcome them.  Bach's system was wiser, for it took his pupils farther, since he did not limit their attention, as his predecessors did, to the harmonic structure, but extended it to the qualities that constitute good writing, namely, consistency of expression, variety of style, rhythm, and melody.  Those who would acquaint themselves with Bach's method of teaching composition will find it fully set forth in Kirnberger's Correct Art of Composition.183\",\n",
       " \"As long as his pupils were under his instruction Bach did not allow them to study any but his own works and the classics.  The critical sense, which permits a man to distinguish good from bad, develops later than the aesthetic faculty and may be blunted and even destroyed by frequent contact with bad music.  The best way to instruct youth is to accustom it early to consort with the best models.  Time brings experience and an instructed judgment to confirm the pupil's early attraction to works of true art.\",\n",
       " \"Under this admirable method of teaching all Bach's pupils became distinguished musicians, some more so than others, according as they came early or late under his influence, and had opportunity and encouragement to perfect and apply the instruction they received from him.  His two eldest sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emmanuel, were his most distinguished pupils, not because he gave them better instruction than the rest, but because from their earliest youth they were brought up amid good music at home.  Even before they began their lessons they knew what was good.  On the other hand, others, before they became Bach's pupils, either had heard no good music or their taste had been already vitiated by contact with bad.  It at least attests the excellence of Bach's method that even his pupils thus handicapped took high rank in their profession and distinguished themselves in one or other of its branches.184\",\n",
       " \"Bach's first pupil was JOHANN CASPAR VOGLER, who received instruction from him in his early days at Amstadt and Weimar and, on Bach's testimony, was an exceedingly able player.  He became organist, and later burgomaster, at Weimar, retaining his professional position.  Some Choral [pg 101]Preludes by him for a two-manualed Organ with pedals were engraved about 1737.185\",\n",
       " 'Other pupils of Bach who became famous were:',\n",
       " \"I have said already that Bach's sons were his most distinguished pupils.  The eldest, WILHELM FRIEDEMANN BACH, came nearest to his father in the originality of his genius.  His melodies have quite a different character from those of other composers.  They are exceedingly clever, elegant, and spontaneous.  When performed with delicacy, as he played them, they cannot fail to charm every hearer.  It is greatly to be regretted that he preferred to follow his fancy in extemporisation and to expend his genius on fugitive thoughts rather than to work them out on paper.  The number of his compositions therefore is small, but all are beautiful.\",\n",
       " 'CARL PHILIPP EMMANUEL BACH, who comes next, went out into the world sufficiently early to discover that it is a good thing for a composer to have a large public behind him.  Hence, in the clearness and easy intelligibility of his compositions, he approaches the popular style, though he scrupulously avoids the commonplace.201 Both he and his elder brother admitted that they were [pg 105]driven to adopt a style of their own by the wish to avoid comparison with their incomparable father.',\n",
       " \"JOHANN CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH BACH, Concertmeister at the Court of Bückeburg, imitated Carl Philipp's style, but was not his equal. According to Wilhelm Friedemann, he was the best player among the brothers, and the most effective performer of their father's Clavier compositions.\",\n",
       " \"JOHANN CHRISTIAN BACH, called “Bach of Milan,” and afterwards “Bach of London,” was the youngest son of Bach's second marriage and of too tender an age when his father died ever to have had lessons from him.  Hence, perhaps, the absence of Bach's style in his music.  He was, in fact, a popular composer universally admired in his day.202\",\n",
       " \"Distinguished as a player, composer, and teacher, Bach was also an indulgent father, a good friend, and a loyal citizen.  His paternal devotion is shown by his care for his children's education, and he was equally assiduous in the performance of his civil and social duties.  His acquaintance was agreeable to everybody.  Every lover of music, whatever his nationality, was sure of a friendly reception at his house, and his sociability and reputation caused him to be seldom without visitors.\",\n",
       " \"As an artist Bach was exceptionally modest.  Notwithstanding his pre-eminence in his profession,a superiority of which he could not but be conscious, and in spite of the admiration and respect daily shown him, he never gave himself airs.  If he was asked the secret of his mastership he would answer, “I was made to work; if you are equally industrious you will be equally successful,”203 a [pg 107]remark which made no allowance for his own exceptional genius.  His opinion of other composers and their work was invariably fair and generous.  Naturally, much of their work struck him as somewhat trivial, viewed from his own altitude.  But he never uttered a harsh criticism, unless it were to a pupil, to whom he held himself bound to say what he thought.  Still less did he presume on his acknowledged superiority to indulge in braggadocio, as often happens with performers brought into touch with those whom they regard as their inferiors.  Herein Bach's modesty went so far that he never spoke voluntarily of his frustrated contest with Marchand, though the latter was the challenger.204Many absurd stories are told of Bach; for instance that, dressed up as a village schoolmaster, he liked to enter a church and ask the organist to let him play a Choral, in order to enjoy the astonishment excited by his playing, or to hear the Organist declare, “This must be Bach or the Devil.”205He always ridiculed such stories, and indeed had too much respect for his art to make it cloak his vanity. \",\n",
       " \"At musical parties where Quartet or other instrumental music was performed, Bach liked to play the Viola, an instrument which put him, as it were, in the middle of the harmony in a position from which he could hear and enjoy it on both sides.  On those occasions he would sometimes join in a Trio or other piece on the Harpsichord.  If he was in the mood and the composer was agreeable, he would, as has been told already, extemporise a new Trio from the Continuo part, or, adding a new part, convert the Trio into a Quartet. But these were the only occasions on which he was ready to display his great powers before others.  One Hurlebusch, of Brunswick,206a conceited and arrogant Clavier player, once visited Bach at Leipzig, not to hear him play, but to play to him.  Bach received him politely and listened patiently to his very indifferent performance. On taking leave Hurlebusch made Bach's eldest sons a present of his published Sonatas, exhorting them to study them diligently. Bach, knowing the kind of music his sons were wont to play, smiled at Hurlebusch's naïveté but did not permit him to suspect his amusement.207\",\n",
       " \"Bach was fond of listening to the music of other composers. If he and one of his elder sons [pg 109]happened to be in church when a Fugue was played, directly the subject had been stated he always pointed out how it ought to be developed.  If the composer knew his business and fulfilled Bach's anticipations, he was pleased and nudged his son to draw his attention to the fact.  Is this not evidence of his impartial interest in other people's compositions? \",\n",
       " \"I have mentioned already the composers whom in his youth Bach esteemed, loved, and studied.  Later, when experience ripened his critical faculty, he had other favourites, among them Imperial Kapellmeister Fux, Handel, Caldara,208 Reinhard Keiser, Hasse,209 the two Grauns,210 Telemann,211 Zelenka,212 Benda,213 etc., and, in general, the distinguished musicians at Dresden and Berlin.  He was acquainted with all except the first four of those I mention.  In his youth Bach was intimate with Telemann.214 He also had a very warm regard [pg 110]for Handel and often expressed a desire to know him.  As Handel, like himself, was a famous performer on the Organ and Clavier, many in Leipzig and its neighbourhood wished to bring the two great men together.  But Handel, then living in London, never found time for a meeting during the visits he paid to Halle, his native town.  On his first visit in 1719, Bach was at Cöthen, only some twenty miles distant.  As soon as he was informed of Handel's arrival he lost not a moment in setting out to visit him, but on his arrival found that Handel had returned to England.  At the time of Handel's second visit, between 1730 and 1740,215 Bach was prevented from leaving Leipzig by indisposition.  But no sooner was he advised of Handel's arrival at Halle than he sent his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, to beg him to visit Leipzig, an invitation which Handel was unable to accept.  In 1752 or 1753, when Handel paid his third visit to Germany,216 Bach was dead. He had always expressed the strongest desire to know Handel, and the Leipzig people were disappointed in their wish to hear the two great men together.\",\n",
       " \"While Hasse was Kapellmeister at Dresden both the Opera and Kapelle flourished.  Bach [pg 111]had many friends at Dresden, who held him in high regard.  Among them may be mentioned Hasse and his wife, the celebrated Faustina.217They often visited Leipzig and were admirers of the Cantor's rare talents.  Hence, at Dresden he was always received in the most respectful manner and often visited the Opera, generally accompanied by his eldest son.  When the time for their journey approached Bach would say in fun, “Well, Friedemann, shall we go to Dresden to hear the pretty tunes218 again?” Innocent as the jest was, I am sure Bach would not have uttered it to any but his son, who already could distinguish between great music and agreeable trifles.\",\n",
       " 'Bach was never in a position to make what is called a brilliant fortune.219 He held a fairly lucrative office, but his income had to maintain and educate a large family.  He neither possessed nor sought other means of livelihood, and was too absorbed in his art and work to think of accepting engagements which, in those days, and to a man of his genius, certainly would have brought riches.  Had he possessed a taste for travel he would, as even one of his detractors admits, have “drawn [pg 112]upon himself the admiration of the whole world.” But he preferred a quiet domestic life, constant occupation in his work, with contentment and a moderate competence, like his forbears.  His modesty, however, did hot prevent him from receiving manifold proofs of regard and affection and marks of honourable distinction.  Prince Leopold of Cöthen, Duke Ernst August of Weimar,220 and Duke Christian of Weissenfels, all showed sincere regard for him, which must have been the more agreeable to him seeing that they were all sound judges of music.  At Berlin, as at Dresden, he was universally honoured and respected.  If we add to these testimonies the fact that he captured the admiration of all who heard him play or were acquainted with his music, then we may be sure that Bach, “singing for himself and the Muses,” received at the hands of Fame the recognition he valued most, and cherished it far more than the trivial honour of a ribbon or gold chain.',\n",
       " ' I add that, in 1747, Bach became a member of the “Society of the Musical Sciences,” founded by Mizler, only because we owe to the circumstance his admirable Choral Variations on Vom Himmel hoch.221 He presented them to the [pg 113]Society on his admission and they were engraved subsequently.222',\n",
       " \"To have produced so many great works in all forms of musical expression Bach necessarily must have been a prolific writer.  For if a composer be the greatest genius in the world, unless he constantly exercises his art he cannot hope to produce real masterpieces.  Superlative excellence is the fruit of indefatigable application.  Yet in Bach's case we should be wrong to acclaim as masterpieces all the products of his great activity just because masterpieces at length were the fruit of it.  Already in his early compositions we find undeniable evidence of genius.  But they are blemished by faults, passages poor in quality, extravagant, insipid, that are hardly worth preserving, though of interest to the student who wishes to trace from its source the development of Bach's genius.\",\n",
       " \"It is not difficult to distinguish with exactitude those of Bach's early compositions which are of the first excellence; for he has been at pains to give us the clue.  As he did not publish his first work until he was about forty years[pg 115]old 223we are justified in assuming the merit of what, at so mature an age, he thought worthy to put into print, and in concluding generally that all his engraved works are of first-rate merit.224\",\n",
       " \"With respect to his unpublished compositions, and they are by far the most numerous, we must in order to distinguish their merit rely partly on a critical examination of their texts, partly on Bach's own judgment.  Like all great composers, he was continually working on his compositions with a view to making them still more finished.  Indeed, he actually attempted to improve some of them that were already perfect.  Any that were susceptible of improvement he improved, even those already engraved.  Such is the origin of the variant readings of his works found in older and more recent texts.  By constantly retouching his compositions Bach aimed at making them indisputable masterpieces.  In this category I place most of what he wrote before the year 1725, as I show in detail in the following catalogue.  A great[pg 116] many compositions subsequent to 1725, which for reasons easily understood are still in MS., bear too evidently the stamp of perfection to leave us in doubt whether to class them as early essays or as the finished work of an accomplished master.\",\n",
       " \"The following are those of Bach's works which have been engraved:\",\n",
       " \"The Variations are models of what such compositions ought to be, though no one has been so rash as to attempt to follow Bach's footsteps.[pg 119]We owe them to Count Kaiserling, formerly Russian Ambassador at the Saxon Electoral Court, who frequently visited Leipzig with Goldberg, already mentioned238 among Bach's pupils.  The Count was a great invalid and suffered from insomnia.  Goldberg lived in the Ambassador's house, and slept in an adjoining room, to be ready to play to him when he was wakeful.  One day the Count asked Bach to write for Goldberg some Clavier music of a soothing and cheerful character, that would relieve the tedium of sleepless nights.  Bach thought a set of Variations most likely to fulfil the Count's needs, though, on account of the recurrence of the same basic harmony throughout, it was a form to which he had hitherto paid little attention.  Like all his compositions at this period, however, the Variations are a masterpiece, and are the only example he has left us of this form.239 The Count always called them “my Variations” and was never weary of hearing them.  For long afterwards, when he could not sleep, he would say, “Play me one of my[pg 120]Variations, Goldberg.” Perhaps Bach was never so well rewarded for any composition as for this.  The Count gave him a golden goblet containing one hundred louis d'ors, though, as a work of art, Bach would not have been overpaid had the present been a thousand times as large.  It may be observed, that in the engraved copy of the Variations there are serious mistakes, which the composer has corrected in his own copy.240\",\n",
       " \"The work consists of fugal Variations planned on the most elaborate scale.249 The composer's intention was to show in what a variety of ways the same theme can be treated fugally.  The Variations (here called “Contrapunctus”)250 are complete Fugues upon the same theme.  The last Fugue of all has three subjects, in the third of which the composer signs his name, B A C H.251[pg 123]Bach was prevented from finishing it by the disorder of his eyes, and as an operation brought no relief the movement was never completed.  It is said that Bach intended to introduce four themes into it and to bring it to an impressive conclusion by inverting them all. All the Fugues in the work are equally smooth and melodious.\",\n",
       " \"To make up for the unfinished Fugue Bach concluded the work with a Choral Prelude upon the tune “Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein,” which he dictated to his son-in-law, Altnikol, a few days before his death.252 Of the extraordinary skill it displays I do not speak, save to remark that even in his last illness it proclaims Bach's skill undiminished.  The pious resignation and devotion that characterise it move me deeply whenever I play it.  Nor should I find it easy to say which I had rather had been omitted, the Choral Prelude, or the conclusion of the unfinished Fugue.\",\n",
       " \"More recently Kirnberger edited, in four volumes, a collection of Bach's Chorals. They are published by Breitkopf.254\",\n",
       " \"Bach's works, still in MS., consist of compositions for the Clavier, Organ, with and without other instruments, Strings, and the voice.  I will enumerate them in that order.\",\n",
       " \"It cannot be denied that, among other blemishes, the Inventions occasionally exhibit melodic poverty and roughness.  But finding them useful to his pupils, Bach eventually revised them and removed from them everything that offended his maturer taste, so that they now stand as masterpieces of pure music.  Moreover they are invaluable exercises for the fingers and hands and are sound instructors of taste.  There is no better introduction to Bach's larger works than they afford.\",\n",
       " 'It is remarkable that this piece, for all its technical skill, appeals to the most unpractised hearer, if it is performed at all tolerably.',\n",
       " \"These are Bach's principal works for the Clavier which can be considered classics.268 A great number of single Suites,269Toccatas and Fugues,270 besides those already mentioned, have great and varying merit, but are youthful works.271 At the most, ten or twelve of them seem to me worth preserving, some of them because they would be useful as finger exercises, for which their author originally intended them, others because they are at least better than similar works by other composers.  As an exercise for the fingers of both hands I particularly single out a Fugue in A minor,272 in which the composer has been at great pains to write florid passages in order to give equal strength and suppleness to both hands.  For beginners a little two-part Fugue273 should also prove useful.  It is melodious, flowing, and not at all old-fashioned.\",\n",
       " 'The pedal is the distinctive feature of the Organ which places it above all other instruments, and gives it its magnificence, sonority, and majesty.  Deprive it of the pedal and you take from it the solemn and imposing tones which are its distinctive utterance, reducing it to the level of a “positiv,” or Chamber-organ, an instrument relatively insignificant.',\n",
       " \"But an Organ equipped with a pedal must be able to employ it in its full compass,285 and both composer and organist must know the proper use of it.  No one excelled Bach in this knowledge.  Not only is his rich harmony and melody singularly adapted to the instrument, but he gave the pedal a part of its own, even in his early compositions.  Yet it was only gradually that he mastered its technique; for his Organ masterpieces belong to the period in which those for the Clavier began to be classics.  His early and immature Organ works are widely dispersed; for as soon as a composer begins to be distinguished everybody is anxious to possess a specimen of his art.  Public curiosity, however, generally dies down long before a composer comes to maturity,[pg 134]particularly if his work is over the heads of the public.  And this seems to have been Bach's fortune.  Consequently his mature Organ works are less familiar than his early efforts.  The latter, however, cannot possibly be admitted to a “correct and critical” edition of his works, and I mention here only those whose merit is as incontestable as that of the Clavier works enumerated in the preceding paragraphs.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's finest Organ music falls into three groups:\",\n",
       " 'There are few instruments for which Bach did not write.  In his day it was usual to play a Concerto or instrumental Solo during the Communion office.295 Bach composed many of these pieces himself, and always with a view to their improving the technique of the player.  Most of them are lost.  But two important works of another kind survive and to some extent compensate us.  They are:',\n",
       " \"Most of these works are now dispersed.  The Church Cantatas were divided between his elder sons after their composer's death.  Wilhelm Friedemann had the larger share because, being organist at Halle, he could make use of them.  Later, circumstances compelled him to part with them gradually.  I know of no other collection of Bach's larger choral works.  There exist, however, eight or ten Motets for double chorus, but they are dispersed in various hands.309 In the collectionbequeathed by the Princess Amalia of Prussia to the Joachimsthal Gymnasium at Berlin there are some of Bach's vocal compositions.310  Their number is not considerable, but among them are the following:\",\n",
       " 'On the MS. of the last-named Cantata and of the Mass for double chorus (No. 3 supra) there is a note by Kirnberger analysing the skill and merit of the compositions.',\n",
       " \"It has been remarked more than once that Bach, throughout his life, devoted much thought to the improvement of his compositions.  I have had frequent occasion to compare the original and subsequent texts of his works, and confess to have experienced both surprise and pleasure in observing his care to improve whatever he thought faulty, to make good better, and better perfect.  Nothing is more instructive than a collation of this kind, whether to the experienced musician or the instructed amateur.  I should like to see a supplement to the complete edition of Bach's works showing these variant readings.323 The collation would be in the highest degree instructive, and to attempt it is as appropriate to the works of the composer, a poet in sound, as to those of the poet in words.\",\n",
       " \"In Bach's early texts he often repeats a phrase to other words with some melodic variety, in a [pg 144]lower or even in the same octave.  In his riper experience he could not tolerate such poverty of workmanship, and cut out these passages remorselessly, without regard for the number and quality of the persons who had approved them in their original state.  There occur to me two good examples of this, the C major and C sharp minor Preludes in the first part of the Well-tempered Clavier. Bach revised them so drastically as to cut them down by one-half, sacrificing passages that he thought redundant.324\",\n",
       " 'In other places Bach tends to be over-concise; he expresses an idea, but does not fully develop it.  The best illustration that occurs to me is the D minor Prelude in the second part of the Well-tempered Clavier.  I possess several texts of it.  In the oldest the first transposition of the theme in the Bass and several other details essential to a complete development of the idea are wanting.  A second MS. gives the theme to the Bass wherever the latter is in a key nearly related to that of the tonic.  In a third MS. these addenda are developed more fully and are joined more skilfully.  But melodic details are present of doubtful relevance to the rest of the composition.  In a fourth MS. these disappear or are amended, so that, as we have it, the Prelude stands as one of the most beautiful and least faulty in the Well-tempered Clavier. Many people, no doubt, [pg 145]preferred the movement in its original form.  But Bach was not a man to be influenced by approbation or criticism.  He went on correcting until he satisfied himself.',\n",
       " 'In the early part of the seventeenth century it was the fashion in instrumental music to overload single notes with ornaments and add florid runs.  Lately it has become the fashion to do so in vocal music as well.  That Bach shared this disposition may be inferred from certain pieces that he wrote in this style.  An instance is the Prelude in E minor in the first part of the Well-tempered Clavier.  But he soon returned to his natural better taste, and altered the movement to the form in which it is engraved.325',\n",
       " \"Every decade has its own style of melody, distinctive of itself and evanescent.  A composer must carefully avoid it if he hopes to be listened to by posterity.  In his young days even Bach ran upon this rock.  His early compositions for the Organ, and the two-part Inventions in their original form, are full of fiorituri such as the taste of his period approved.  His Organ compositions remain comparatively untouched, but the Inventions he closely revised.  The public will soon be able to compare them in their first and later forms, as the publishers, with admirable spirit, have resolved to discontinue the present edition[pg 146]and to send out to subscribers a revised one based on Bach's corrected text.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's processes of revision so far mentioned, however, merely correct faults of form, that is, diffuseness or incomplete development of a musical thought.  But Bach employed other methods which are less easy to describe because they are more subtle.  He often rivets the style and character of a piece by changing a single note, strictly correct grammatically and yet disagreeable to an artist such as himself.  Even commonplace passages he could convert into phrases of beauty by the addition or alteration of a single note.  Only the most sensitive taste and trained experience can decide in such cases, and Bach possessed both in the highest perfection.  He developed them to such a pitch, indeed, that his brain eventually rejected any idea which, in all its properties and relations, did not accord inevitably and naturally with the whole composition.  Consequently his later works display such consistency of merit that all of them seem to have been cast complete in a mould, so smooth, facile and abundant is the flow of his rich fancy.  It is on the highest summits of the art that harmony and melody find their ideal union, and as yet Bach dwells there in majestic isolation.\",\n",
       " \"It is surely unnecessary to ask whether that artist is a genius who, in every form of his art, has produced masterpiece after masterpiece, of an originality which sets them above the achievements of all other ages, distinguished also by a wealth of originality and agreeableness that enslaves every hearer.  The most fertile fancy, invention inexhaustible, a judgment so nice as to reject intuitively every irrelevant and jarring detail, unerring ingenuity in employing the most delicate and minute resources of his art, along with an unrivalled technique—these qualities, whose expression demands the outpouring of a man's whole soul, are the signboards of genius.  The man who cannot find them in Bach's music either is not acquainted with it at all or knows it imperfectly.  One needs to be steeped in it thoroughly to appreciate the genius of its author.  For the greater the work the closer study is demanded for its apprehension.  The butterfly method, a sip here and there, is of little use.  But admirable as were the gifts Bach received[pg 148]from nature, he could never have become an accomplished genius had he not learned betimes to avoid the rocks on which many artists, some of them perhaps not less gifted than he, too often founder.  I will communicate to the reader some scattered thoughts on the subject and conclude this essay with an indication of the characteristics of Bach's genius.\",\n",
       " 'Even the largest natural gifts, coupled with the strongest propensity for a particular art, offer no more than fruitful soil on which that art may thrive by patient cultivation.  Industry, the true begetter of every art and science, is an indispensable factor.  Not only does it enable genius to master technique, but it stimulates the critical and reflective faculties also.  The very ease with which genius acquires and applies the apparatus of musical composition frequently entices it to leap over root principles in its plunge into deeper waters, or to fly before its wings are grown.  In such a case, unless genius is guided back to neglected fundamentals and forced to build itself upon the great examples of the past, it will inevitably expend its treasure uselessly and never attain to its promised dimensions.  For it is an axiom, that real progress can never be made, nor the highest perfection be attained, if the foundations are insecure.  If arduous heights are to be achieved, the easier obstacles must first be approached and overcome.  Guided by his own [pg 149]inexperience no one ever can hope to become great.  He must profit by the practice and example of others.',\n",
       " \"Bach did not founder on this rock.  His soaring genius attended an equally ardent industry which incessantly impelled him, whenever he found his own equipment insufficient, to seek guidance from others.  Vivaldi and his Concertos were the first from whom he sought counsel.  From them he turned to the principal Organ and Clavier composers of the period.  Nothing is more intellectually stimulating than counterpoint, and the composers Bach studied were distinguished by their mastery of it, as their fugal writing attests.  Hence Bach's diligent study and imitation of them pointed his taste and imagination to perceive wherein himself was lacking and what steps were needed to take him farther in his art.\",\n",
       " \"A second rock upon which genius often comes to grief is the public's undiscriminating applause.  To be sure, I do not undervalue public approval or commend without reserve the remark of a Greek teacher to his pupil, “You performed badly, otherwise the audience would not have applauded you.”  Yet it is none the less true that many artists are thrown off their balance by exaggerated and often unmerited plaudits, particularly in their early careers before they have acquired self-discipline and sound judgment.  The public merely asks for what it can understand, whereas the true[pg 150]artist ought to aim at an achievement which cannot be measured by popular standards.  How, then, can popular applause be reconciled with the true artist's aspirations towards the ideal?  Bach never sought applause, and held with Schiller:\",\n",
       " 'Like every true artist, Bach worked to please himself in his own way, obeying the summons of his own genius, choosing his own subjects, and finding satisfaction only in the approval of his own judgment.  He could count on the applause of all who understood good music, and never failed to receive it.  Under what other conditions can sound works of art emerge?  The composer who debases his muse to the popular mood either lacks real genius or, having it, abuses it.  For to catch the ear of the public is not a difficult task and merely connotes an agreeable facility.  Composers of that class are like artisans who frankly fashion their goods to suit their market.  But Bach never condescended to such artifices.  The artist, in his judgment, is the dictator of public taste, not its slave.  If, as often happened, he was asked to write something simple for the Clavier[pg 151]he would answer, “I will do what I can.”  He would choose an easy theme.  But when he began to develop it he always found so much to say that the piece soon became anything but simple.  If his attention was drawn to the fact, he would answer smilingly, “Practise it well and you will find it quite easy.  You have as many good fingers on each hand as I have.”  Nor was he prompted in this by mere contradictoriness, but exhibited the true artist spirit.',\n",
       " \"It was, in fact, the artist temperament that led Bach to make the great and sublime his goal.  For that reason his music is not merely agreeable, like other composers', but transports us to the regions of the ideal.  It does not arrest our attention momentarily but grips us the stronger the oftener we listen to it, so that after a thousand hearings its treasures are still unexhausted and yield fresh beauties to excite our wonder.  Even the beginner who knows but the A B C of his art warms with pleasure when he hears Bach's music and can open his ear and heart to it.  It was the true artist spirit, too, that guided Bach to unite majesty and grandeur of design with meticulous care for detail and the most refined elegance, characteristics which we rather seek, perhaps, in works whose object is merely to give pleasure.  Bach held strongly that if the strands are imperfect, the whole design is faulty.

       " 'To conclude: it was the union of astounding genius and indefatigable application that enabled Bach to widen at every point the domain of musical expression.  His successors have failed to maintain the art at the level to which he raised it.  If Bach was more successful, if he was able to produce great work of convincing beauty and imperishable as a model for those who came after him, we owe it as much to his application as to his genius.',\n",

       " \"We have the statement of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach,346 confirmed by Forkel,347 Bach's earliest biographer, that his father composed five Cantatas for every Sunday and Festival of the ecclesiastical year.  Concerted music was sung at Leipzig annually on forty-three Sundays and sixteen week-days.348 Bach therefore must have written at least 295 Cantatas.  Of this number he composed at least thirty before 1723.  Hence approximately 265 were written at Leipzig.  But Bach's fertility does not appear to have outlived the year 1744.  We have reason, therefore, to conclude that the 265 Leipzig Cantatas were written in the course of twenty-one years, that is, between 1723 and 1744.  To complete that number Bach must have composed a new Cantata every month, a surprising but demonstrable conclusion.\",\n",
       " \"Of the 295 Cantatas only 202 have come down to us, three of them in an incomplete state.349 Of those written before 1723 the survivors are too scanty to indicate a rate of productivity.  But thereafter we have fuller materials for a calculation.  Bach, as Cantor, conducted his first Leipzig Cantata on May 30, 1723, and in the following sixteen months produced twenty-four Cantatas, at the [pg 164]rate of more than one a month.350 Beginning at the New Year of 1725 he wrote eighteen Cantatas in nine months, some of which, however, may belong to the years 1726-7-8-9.  But even so, his monthly average seems to have been maintained.  For 1730 we have, perhaps, ten Cantatas.  For 1731 about twenty survive, of which half a dozen may belong to 1732, a deduction which still preserves Bach's steady average.  In 1735 he produced actually nineteen Cantatas between the New Year and the following November, though not all of them are positively dated.  Thereafter his activity is less certainly measured.  But from 1736 till the end of 1744 he composed fifty-three Cantatas, at the rate, that is, of at least six every year, without making allowance for Cantatas written and lost.\",\n",
       " \"There are few phenomena in the record of art more extraordinary than this unflagging cataract of inspiration, in which masterpiece followed masterpiece with the monotonous periodicity of a Sunday sermon.  Its musical significance has been presented with illuminating exegesis by more than one commentator.  But its literary apparatus has captured little attention.  Yet Bach's task must have been materially eased or aggravated according as the supply of libretti was regular or infrequent, while the flow of his inspiration must have been governed by their quality.  Moreover, the libretto was the medium through which he offered the homage of his art to the service of God.  The subject therefore deserves attention.  However trivial, measured against the immensities of Bach's genius, the study will at least provide a platform from which to contemplate it.\",\n",
       " \"At the outset the opinion may be hazarded that the provision of his weekly libretti caused Bach greater anxiety than the setting of them to music, a task which he accomplished with almost magical facility. It is [pg 165]true that from the early part of the 18th century cycles of Cantata texts for the Church's year were not infrequently published.  Bach was in more or less intimate touch with the authors of four, perhaps five, printed collections of the kind.  But he used them with surprising infrequency.  Neumeister's published cycles provided him with seven libretti,351 Franck's with sixteen,352 Picander's with ten,353 Marianne von Ziegler's with nine,354 and Helbig's with two.355 He took three libretti from the Bible,356 and the hymn-book furnished him with eleven more.357 But all these published sources together only account for fifty-eight texts.  Bach possessed only one book that could assist his own efforts at authorship—Paul Wagner's eight-volumed Hymn-book—whence he took the stanzas which decorate his Cantatas like jewels in the rare settings he gave them.  It was, therefore, mainly upon writers with whom he was brought into occasional or official contact that Bach depended for his texts.\",\n",
       " \"At the beginning of his career Bach was thrown upon his inexperience.  His earliest libretti, consequently, are tentative and transitory in their construction.  His first Cantata was written at Arnstadt for the Easter Festival of 1704.358 The core of the libretto is a seven-stanzaed Easter song by an unknown poet, eked out by two passages of Scripture, a Excitativo, Aria, and a verse of a congregational hymn.  The Aria and Recitativo are the only original numbers of the libretto, and there is little[pg 166]doubt that Bach wrote them himself.359 But the whole libretto is stamped by his personality, and reveals the inveterate subjectivity of his religion.  For, disregarding the general message of the Festival, the libretto opens on the soul's personal longing for immortality and closes on its song of victory over death.  In construction it is archaic, a survival of traditions acquired from central and northern Germany through Bach's earlier residence at Lüneburg and intercourse with Hamburg.360\",\n",
       " \"Three years passed before Bach produced his next extant Cantata. In the interval, on 29th June 1707, he resigned his Arnstadt appointment to become organist of the Church of St. Blasius at Mühlhausen.361 Here, within the space of ten months, he produced three Cantatas, the uniform character of whose libretti points to local and transitory influence upon the composer.  The first of them,362 written in August 1707, is a setting of Psalm 130, with the addition of two hymn-stanzas.  The second363 was performed on 4th February 1708, at the inauguration of the Mühlhausen Town Council, and consists of Old Testament passages, a verse of a hymn, and three original stanzas.  The third,364 a wedding Cantata, was performed at Dornheim, near Arnstadt, on 5th June 1708, at the marriage of Pastor Johann Lorenz Stauber to Frau Bach's aunt, and is set to four verses of Psalm 115.\",\n",
       " \"We can have little doubt regarding the authorship of these singularly austere libretti, so far removed in atmosphere from those of Bach's subsequent periods.  In fact, the clue is furnished by Bach himself.  A note in his handwriting on the score of the first of the three[pg 167]Cantatas (No. 131) states that he composed it at the request of Georg Christian Eilmar.  The man was a close friend, godfather of Bach's eldest daughter, Katharina Dorothea (b. 1708), chief pastor of the Church of the Blessed Virgin, and Consistorial Assessor, at Mühlhausen.  He was, moreover, an aggressive foe of Pietism, of which Mühlhausen was the citadel, and Bach's minister, Frohne, the protagonist.  Indeed, the two men waged so public and wordy a warfare365 that Bach's social relations with the one and official connection with the other must have been rendered difficult.  To his settled convictions regarding the fellowship of music and worship Pietism offered Puritan opposition.  In fact, its lack of sympathy eventually drove him from Mühlhausen, in hope, in his own words, “to realise my views upon the right ordering of Church music without vexation from others.”366 Eilmar, on the other hand, though he admitted the aesthetic value of music, conspicuously lacked the warmth and emotionalism of Bach's religious temperament.  To him undoubtedly we must attribute the cold austerity of the three Mühlhausen libretti and the suppression of the personal note already sounded in Bach's Arnstadt Cantata.  Nor did Eilmar's influence pass with Bach's departure from Mühlhausen.367 It is to be traced in the early libretti of the Weimar period.\",\n",
       " \"The Weimar Cantatas are twenty-two in number, of which all but three were written subsequently to Bach's appointment as Concertmeister early in 1714. He had been organist to the Ducal Court of Weimar since June 1708, a position which did not require him to compose for the Ducal Chapel. On the other hand, three Cantatas are attributed to the early Weimar years. But they[pg 168]cannot be positively dated, and their libretti bear such clear traces of Eilmar's influence that their composition may belong rather to the Mühlhausen period.  Their texts display Eilmar's preference for strictly Biblical material and a disinclination to employ secular forms.  The first of them368 is a paraphrase of the Magnificat. The second369 consists of four verses of Psalm 25, along with three simple rhymed stanzas which we have no difficulty in attributing to Bach himself.  The third, Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit (No. 106), was composed, Spitta conjectures,370 for the funeral of Philipp Grossgebauer, Rector of Weimar School, in 1711.  But more recently, and more probably, Pirro371 has expressed the opinion that Bach wrote it for the funeral of his uncle, Tobias Lammerhirt, who was buried at Erfurt in September 1707.  The theory accords with the suggestion that all three Cantatas belong to the Mühlhausen period.  If so, it is probable that the libretto, a very ingenious mosaic of Scripture texts, was written by Eilmar for the occasion.  It is the last in which we detect his influence.\",\n",
       " \"Bach's appointment as Ducal Concertmeister at Weimar can be placed between 14th January and 19th March 1714372and, it is probable, was nearer the former date.  He seems to have produced the first Cantata his new post required him to write on Sexagesima Sunday, which fell on 4th February in that year.  From thence to the end of 1716 he produced nineteen Cantatas and collaborated with a writer whose libretti at length gave him a satisfactory literary medium.\",\n",
       " \"The new poet, Erdmann Neumeister, four of whose libretti Bach set to music immediately after his [pg 169]appointment, and a fifth a year later,373 was considerably Bach's senior.374 As far back as 1700 he had begun to write a cycle of Cantata texts for the Ducal Chapel at Weissenfels, and pubushed it in 1704, with an explanatory Preface referred to later.375 In 1708 he issued a second cycle for the Court of Rudolstadt, while in 1711 and 1714 third and fourth cycles were written for the Ducal Chapel at Eisenach.  All four cycles were reissued in 1716,376 with the addition of a fifth and a Preface, which lauded Neumeister as “the first German to give sacred music its fitting position by introducing and perfecting the Church Cantata.”377\",\n",
       " \"Spitta has dealt exhaustively378 with the evolution and construction of the Neumeister libretto.  It need only be remarked that it adapted a secular or operatic apparatus to the service of religion, and that the innovation, hateful to many, triumphed because of Neumeister's delicate handling of it.  He perfected the new form, however, in stages.  “A Cantata,” he insisted in his 1704 Preface, “is simply a fragment of Opera made up of Aria and Recitativo.”  But the restriction excluded from the Cantata its most appropriate material.  In his 1708 cycle he found a place for the chorus.  Finally, he admitted the Bible stanza and congregational hymn.  With their inclusion the Cantata libretto assumed the form familiar to us in Bach's use.  It represents a combination of secular Opera and ecclesiastical Motet.  The free Arias and Recitativi are derived from the one, the Bible stanzas and congregational hymns perpetuate the traditions of the other. Unity of design is stamped on[pg 170]the whole by its general subordination to the Gospel for the Day.  Thus, at the moment when Bach was about to devote his genius to the Cantata, Neumeister opportunely provided him with a libretto singularly adapted to the end Bach had in view, and appropriate to the musical expression by which he proposed to secure it.  He adhered to it almost to the end of his life, and found unfailing inspiration in Neumeister's sincerity, delicacy, and uniformly religious outlook.  Neumeister's Arias, with a single exception,379 are hymn-like in mood and metre.  His Recitativi are reflective and prayerful, rarely oratorical or pictorial, simple communings upon the Gospel themes which the libretto handles.380\",\n",
       " \"Bach's early introduction to Neumeister's texts is explained by the close relations between the Courts of Weimar and Eisenach, by his associations with his own birthplace, and his intimacy with Georg Philipp Telemann, Kapellmeister there, for whose use Neumeister's third and fourth cycles were written.381 Bach set, in all, seven of the libretti—four from the fourth cycle,382 one from the third,383 and two from the first,384 one of which (No. 142) differs so much from the published version as to raise the question whether Bach did not receive it direct from Neumeister in the form in which he set it.385\",\n",
       " \"That Bach should have set no more than seven of Neumeister's texts386 is strange.  He shrank, perhaps, from appropriating libretti on which his friend Telemann had a prior claim.387 But the reason is found rather in the fact that at Weimar Bach discovered in 1715 a local[pg 171]poet of first-rate ability who, with perhaps but one exception, wrote the libretti of all the Cantatas he composed during the last two years of his Weimar appointment.\",\n",
       " \"Salomo Franck, Bach's new collaborator, was Curator of the Ducal Museum of Coins and Medals at Weimar.  He was twenty-six years older than Bach.  But Spitta's conjecture,388 that the two men were not acquainted, is hardly tenable.  Both resided in the same small provincial town, both were in the Duke's service, and throughout 1715 and 1716 collaborated in at least ten Cantatas performed in the Ducal Chapel.  Moreover, though the Preface of Franck's first cycle is dated 4th June 1715,389 Bach had already set one of its libretti for Easter of that year. A second cycle of texts, of which Bach made little use,390 was published by Franck in 1717.391\",\n",
       " \"Schweitzer, no doubt, is correct in his conclusion392 that Bach was drawn to Franck by his poetic insight, his mysticism, and innate feeling for nature.  It must be remembered, too, that his libretti were, in some degree, official.  On the other hand, Franck was Neumeister's inferior in ability to conceive a picture fit to express Bach's larger moods, and on occasion could descend to sheer bathos.393 But his texts have a rhythmic swing and melody which Bach found agreeable.  He set at least sixteen of them, and returned to them even after he settled at Leipzig.\",\n",
       " \"The circumstances which terminated Bach's service at Weimar are familiar, and need not be restated.  He received a new appointment at Cöthen on 1st August 1717, and took up his duties there, probably at Christmas, that year.394 His position was that of Capellmeister to the princely Court.  He never styles himself Court Organist,395 and his duties severed him for five years from the service of the Church, to which he had declared his particular dedication in 1708.  The Cöthen Court was unpretentious.  The Prince was a Calvinist.  Figurate music was not permitted in the Court Chapel, and its Organ was small and inadequate.  Hence Bach devoted himself chiefly to chamber music, and only two genuine Church Cantatas belong to this period of his career.  Both must have been written for performance elsewhere, possibly in connection with Bach's frequent Autumn tours as a performer.396\",\n",
       " \"For both Cantatas Bach employed a librettist, otherwise little known, named Johann Friedrich Helbig, State Secretory to the Eisenach Court. In March 1720,397 more than two years after Bach's arrival at Cöthen, Helbig published a cycle of “Musical Texts on the Sunday and Saints' Day Gospels throughout the year,” for performance “in God's honour by the Prince's Kapelle at Eisenach.”398How they came into Bach's hands we do not know, but can readily conjecture.  They are indifferent poetry, judging them by the two specimens Bach made use of, and are uniform in construction.  The first movement invariably is a Chorus upon a text from the Gospel for the Day, or a Scripture passage closely related to it.  Two Arias separated by a Recitative follow. A Choral brings the libretto to an end.399\",\n",
       " \"The first of the two Cantatas written to Helbig's words[pg 173]was designed for the Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity, which fell in 1720 on September 22.400 Spitta conjectures401 that Bach intended it for performance at Hamburg.  In fact, his wife's death postponed Bach's visit to that town until November, by which date the Sunday appropriate to the Cantata had passed. Spitta holds that the Cantata may have been performed, after all, during the visit. Schweitzer is sceptical.402 But Bach certainly expended great pains upon the score.\",\n",
       " \"The second Helbig Cantata403 is for the Third Sunday in Advent, and the date of it would appear to have been 1721.  It is one of the least agreeable of Bach's works.  Spitta 404 declares it a juvenile composition hastily adapted to a new libretto. Schweitzer405 expresses the same opinion, and Sir Hubert Parry406 finds the work “rather commonplace.”  Its genuineness is discussed by Max Schreyer in the “Bach-Jahrbuch” for 1912, and more recently Rudolf Wustmann has insisted that it does not bear the stamp of Bach's genius.407 If it actually was composed in 1721, its production must have coincided with Bach's second marriage on December 3 of that year.408 In that case, his resort to old material is explicable.\",\n",
       " 'Only these two Cantatas were composed at Cöthen.  But later, at Leipzig, two others were manufactured out of secular material written there.409 It is unnecessary to refer to them, except to remark that in each case Bach appears to have been the author of the new libretto.  In the first of them410 it is clear that he was handicapped by the frankly secular metre of the original stanzas.  The [pg 174]second of them,411 originally a Birthday Ode to Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen, is a masterly conversion into a Whit-Monday text which, assuming that Bach wrote it, puts his literary facility beyond question.',\n",
       " \"Bach made the last move in his professional career on May 31, 1723, when he was inducted Cantor of St. Thomas' School at Leipzig, with particular charge of the Churches of St. Thomas and St. Nicolas.  Here by far the greater number of his Cantatas appeared, and 172 of them survive.  They are too numerous to be considered individually, and their classification is rendered difficult by the fact that the authorship of most of their libretti is conjectural and not ascertained.  They fall, however, into two large categories, each of which exhibits characteristics of its own.\",\n",
       " \"The dividing year, clearly but not arbitrarily, is 1734.  Before it and after it Bach was aided by new writers.  But the earlier period pre-eminently was one of experiment, out of which emerged the glorified hymn-libretto, or Choral Cantata, of Bach's last years.  That it sprang, in some degree, from the difficulty of finding good original texts in sufficient number may be granted.  That it was adopted as an avenue of escape from Picander's coarser work is a conjecture based, apparently, upon a prevalent exaggeration of Bach's dependence on that writer.  The fundamental reason which led Bach to the hymn-libretto undoubtedly was the fact that it most closely fulfilled the ideals which informed his work.\",\n",
       " \"The first Cantata performed during Bach's Cantorship412 reveals a new author, whose assistance, if the conclusion is well grounded, was at Bach's disposal throughout the whole of the earlier Leipzig period.  Spitta's keen insight failed him in this instance.  He betrays no recognition of [pg 175]the new writer, and occasionally413 attributes his libretti to Picander.  The credit of the discovery belongs to Rudolf Wustmann, though he fails to work it out to its fullest conclusions.414\",\n",
       " \"No one can read the early Leipzig libretti without being struck by the number of them that are not only uniform in structure, but similar in tone and point.  They all begin with a Bible text, chosen frequently, but not invariably, from the Gospel for the Day.  Every one of them ends with a hymn-stanza.  Their Arias, with hardly an exception,415 are written in what, compared with Picander's rollicking dactyls, may be held hymn-metres.  Their Recitativi, almost invariably, are didactic or exegetical.416 They do not display the vapid rhetoric of Picander.  Nor do they express the reflective or prayerful mood that reveals Bach.  They are essentially expositive and, it is noticeable, are studded with direct or veiled references to Bible passages which expand or enforce the lesson of the initial text.  In a word, they suggest the work of a preacher casting his sermon notes into lyrical form, an impression which is strengthened by the fact that the libretto invariably opens with a Scripture passage and frequently blends the Gospel and Epistle for the Day in one harmonious teaching.  Spitta detected this characteristic.  But he failed to follow up the clue.  He speaks417 of one of these texts418 as a “moralising homily,” a phrase concisely appropriate to them all.  Moreover, a remark of his,419 pointing the significance[pg 176]of the god-parents chosen by Bach for his children—Eilmar, for instance—as revealing Bach's intimate associates at the moment, affords another clue to the personality of the new writer.\",\n",
       " \"Among the clergy of St. Thomas' during Bach's Cantorate were two men, father and son, each of whom bore the name Christian Weiss.  The elder was Pastor of the Church from 1714 till his death in 1737.  He was a cultured man, in touch with the University, and possibly formed a link between it and Bach, to whom he showed greater cordiality than the Cantor received from other clerical colleagues.  In 1732 his daughter, Dorothea Sophia stood godmother to Bach's son, Johann Christoph Friedrich, afterwards famous as the “Bückeburg Bach.”420 In 1737 his son stood sponsor to Bach's daughter, Johanna Caroline.421 Nor can it be altogether without significance that the names Dorothea, Sophia, Christian, are borne by others of Bach's children by his second marriage.  There is sufficient evidence, therefore, that Bach's relations with the elder Weiss were intimate enough to support a literary partnership.  Moreover, circumstances lend weight to the inference.  For some years before Bach's arrival in Leipzig, Weiss suffered from an affection of the throat which kept him from the pulpit.  But, during the first year of Bach's Cantorate, he was able to resume his preaching.  If he was, in fact, the author of the libretti, we can have little difficulty in concluding that they and his sermons were built on the same text.\",\n",
       " \"So far as they can be identified—the attempt is somewhat speculative—Weiss provided Bach with at least thirty-three libretti.  He set five of them in 1723, three in 1724, nine in or about 1725, one in 1727, two in 1730, six in 1731, three in 1732, and four in the later Leipzig period.422 Fourteen others bear a constructional[pg 177]resemblance to Weiss's texts,423 but their character refers them rather to Bach or Picander.  Even so, if we do not exaggerate his activity, Weiss seems to have written at least one-sixth of the Leipzig libretti and more than a quarter of those of the earlier period.  Without a doubt he eased a difficult situation in Bach's experience before his regular association with Picander began.\",\n",
       " \"Apart from their revelation of Christian Weiss, the libretti of Bach's first year at Leipzig do not call for comment.  Franck and Neumeister appear among them, and we trace Bach's hand in nine.424 But at Easter, 1724, he broke new ground with a libretto whence developed the Cantata form of his latest period.\",\n",
       " \"The Cantata for Easter Day 1724,425 is Bach's earliest setting of an entire congregational hymn.  Spitta suggests426 that he felt the fitness of giving the libretto an antique character to match the hymn's melody.  However that may be, Bach would appear already to have been groping towards the Choral Cantata of the late '30's.  And though he did not repeat the experiment until the Easter of 1731,427 he treated three hymn-libretti in the interval in a manner which shows him already to have worked out the essentials of the Choral Cantata form.428\",\n",
       " 'Another landmark meets us a year and a half after the Easter experiment.  On September 23, 1725(?)—the Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity—Bach produced a Cantata429 whose Arias are set to words which had appeared in print in the preceding year.  Their author was a hack writer named Christian Friedrich Henrici, or, as he preferred to style himself, Picander.  His hand probably[pg 178]is also traced in the libretto used by Bach on the preceding Sunday430 and again in that for Sexagesima in the same year.431 But the evidence is only inferential.  That he collaborated with Bach on September 23, 1725 (?), is incontestable, and the work defines the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership.',\n",
       " \"Spitta,432 who tells us all that is known of Picander, has sufficiently exposed his superficial literary facility.  He commenced to write sacred poetry in 1724, and on Advent Sunday of that year began a cycle of “Profitable Thoughts,” so he termed them, upon the Sunday and Saints' Day Gospels.  He published them in 1725, when the cycle was complete.433 Three years later he issued a cycle of Cantata texts for 1728-29 in the Neumeister form.434 That he intended them for Bach's use is apparent in the fact that he expressly dedicated them to the service of “our incomparable Capellmeister.”  But Bach made the sparest use of them and of the earlier “Profitable Thoughts” alike.  From the latter he took not one libretto.435 Of the 1728-29 cycle he used only eight texts.436 One more libretto can be referred to Picander's later publications,437 and of six others we can be sure that they are based upon his texts.438 In other words, of the original libretti of the Leipzig period we can trace Picander's hand positively in no more than fifteen.\",\n",
       " \"It is necessary to emphasise this point. For Spitta439 has stated positively that Picander wrote “most” of the Leipzig libretti, and his opinion has been generally[pg 179]accepted.  But its correctness may be contested.  It is suspicious, to begin with, that Picander never published the texts which Spitta asserts him to have poured out in such profusion. “He placed no value,” Spitta answers readily, “on these manufactured compositions, put together hastily to please his friend.”  But the argument cannot stand.  Why should Picander have thought less of libretti actually used by his “incomparable Capellmeister” than of those published for and rejected by him?—for Spitta does not venture to declare that as literature the rejected were superior to the accepted texts.  If out of a published cycle of libretti expressly written for him Bach chose only eight texts, are Picander's “manufactured compositions,” as Spitta calls them, likely to have attracted him to a greater degree?  We can detect his hand perhaps in six Cantatas440 besides those already mentioned, and Bach relied on him exclusively for his secular texts.  One concludes, none the less, that Bach rarely accepted an original Cantata libretto from Picander, and employed him chiefly on the Choral Cantatas of his latest period.  Excluding them, and adding the probable to the actual original Picander texts, they total only twenty-one, a fraction inadequate to support Spitta's sweeping statement.\",\n",
       " 'From the advent of Picander in 1725, to the end of the first Leipzig period nine years later, Bach does not seem to have gone outside the circle of familial authors for his regular Cantata texts.  On October 17, 1727, however, he produced a funeral Cantata, or “Trauer-Musik,” in memory of the late Queen of Poland, the libretto of which was written by Professor J. C. Gottsched.  The partnership, in fact, was accidental: the libretto was supplied to Bach with the commission to set it to music, and, so far as is known, Gottsched and he did not collaborate again.',\n",
       " \"So, reviewing Bach's activities during his first eleven years at Leipzig, we find that of the hundred libretti set by him to music Christian Weiss heads the list as the presumed author of twenty-nine.  Bach follows him with eighteen.441 Picander's hand appears in fifteen, Franck's in eight,442 Neumeister's and Gottsched's in one each.  Fifteen libretti are congregational hymns in their original or paraphrased form.  One is the Gloria in Excelsis of the B minor Mass adapted as a Christmas Cantata (No. 190).  Twelve are by authors not identified.\",\n",
       " 'Passing to the later Leipzig period, seventy-two surviving Cantatas are attributed to the years 1735-50.  They reveal one, perhaps two, new writers.  The first of them, Marianne von Ziegler, was identified by Spitta in 1892.  She was the widow of an officer, resident in Leipzig, a cultured woman, in touch with University life, her house a salon for music and musicians.443 There is no reason to suppose Bach to have been of her circle, or that he was acquainted with her literary gifts.  Indeed the contrary is to be inferred from the fact that, though she published her poems in 1728,444 he does not seem to have known them until seven years later, when he used them for nine consecutive Sundays and Festivals in 1735, beginning on the Third Sunday after Easter, and ending on Trinity Sunday.',\n",
       " \"In addition to these nine libretti, both Spitta445and Schweitzer446 attribute to her the text of Bach's Cantata for the Second Sunday after Easter in the same year.447 It is uniform in construction with the authentic nine, but is not among the authoress's published works. Wustmann448[pg 181]finds the tone of the libretto less ardent and its rhythm rougher than those published under her name.  Admitting the soundness of Wustmann's criticism, one hazards the opinion that the challenged text was written at the period when Bach set it, namely, in 1735, eight years after the poetess published her earlier texts.  The difference of time may account for the difference of texture to which Wustmann draws attention, but leaves undecided the question whether Bach was drawn to the earlier through the later and unpublished texts or vice versa.  It is quite probable that he set other libretti by the same writer, though Schweitzer's449 attribution to her of a second text for Ascension Day, 1735, must be rejected.450\",\n",
       " \"It is worth noticing, since it certainly reveals Bach's preference, that Marianne von Ziegler's libretti are constructed almost invariably in the Weiss form.  Every one of them but three451 opens with a Bible passage, invariably taken from St. John's Gospel, which provides the Gospel for the Day from the First Sunday after Easter down to Trinity Sunday, excepting Ascension Day.  All but one (No. 68) of the libretti conclude with a Choral, and their Arias are hymn-like in metre.  The tone of them, however, is warmer, more personal, less didactic than the Weiss texts.  That Bach regarded them with particular favour is apparent in the circumstance that he took the trouble to revise all but one of them.452 That they stirred his genius deeply is visible in the settings he gave them.\",\n",
       " \"After 1735 the chronology of the Cantatas is not certainly ascertained.  Of those that fall after the Ziegler year, as we may term it, the majority can only be dated approximately as circa 1740, that is, anywhere between 1735 and 1744.  Nor, except rarely, can we detect in their libretti the work of those on whom Bach elsewhere[pg 182] relied.  Weiss, who died late in 1737, is only an occasional contributor.  The texts of this period, in fact, are the outcome of Bach's own experiments in libretto form.  Thirty-three of them are Choral Cantatas, whose evolution it remains to trace concisely.\",\n",
       " \"That Bach should have turned to Lutheran hymnody, chiefly of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that the Cantatas built upon it should be his most perfect religious work is not surprising.  The hymns and their melodies were the foundations upon which the temple of German Protestantism had been reared.  They appealed vividly and powerfully to Bach's spiritual nature, and profoundly influenced his musical utterance.  His whole career, as Sir Hubert Parry points out,453 was an effort to widen his means for self-expression.  And the Choral Cantata, in effect, was the reconciliation or blending of this self-discipline.  It was the supreme achievement of Bach's genius to assert the faith and idealism of Lutheran hymnody with the fullest resources of his technique.\",\n",
       " \"It is not our task to consider the hymn libretto in its relation to the structure of Bach's latest Cantatas.  Necessarily it tied him to a stereotyped design, which he clung to with greater persistency because it exactly fulfilled his devotional purpose.  But experience compelled him, after a brief trial, to discard the simple hymn libretto.  In the earlier Leipzig years as many as eight Choral Cantatas454 are set to the unaltered text of a congregational hymn.  In the later Leipzig period only two455 libretti are of that character.  Bach, in fact, soon realised that, while the unaltered hymn-stanza, with its uniform metre and balanced rhyme, was appropriate to the simple Choral or elaborate Fantasia, it was unmalleable for use as an Aria or Recitative.  Hence, retaining the unaltered Hymn-stanza for the musical movements[pg 183]congruous to it, he was led to paraphrase, in free madrigal form, those stanzas which he selected for the Arias and Recitativi.\",\n",
       " \"As early as September 16, 1725,456 Bach was moving towards this solution.  And it is significant that Picander's hand is visible in the libretto.  The next example457 occurs three years later, and again reveals Picander's authorship.  Two other instances also occur in the early Leipzig period.458 To that point, however, it is clear that Bach was not satisfied as to the most effective treatment of the hymn-libretto.  But in the second Leipzig period, after his collaboration with Marianne von Ziegler, he arrived at and remained constant to a uniform design.  Of the thirty-nine Choral Cantatas of the whole period only two exhibit the earlier form.  Of all the others the libretto consists partly of unaltered hymn-stanzas—invariably used for the first and last movements, and occasionally elsewhere—but chiefly of paraphrased stanzas of the hymn, whose accustomed melody, wherever else it may be introduced, is associated invariably with the hymn when the text is used in its unaltered form.  We, to whom both words and melody are too frequently unfamiliar, may view the perfections of the Choral Cantata with some detachment.  But Bach's audience listened to hymns and tunes which were in the heart of every hearer and a common possession of them all.  The appeal of his message was the more arresting because it spoke as directly to himself as to those he addressed.\",\n",
       " \"It would be satisfactory and interesting to point positively to Bach's own handiwork in these libretti, of which he set fifty-four in the period 1724-44.  Unfortunately it is impossible to do so, except, perhaps, in a single case,459[pg 184]where we can reasonably infer that the libretto is his.  Of the rest, one is by Franck.460 In eighteen of them the hand of Picander is more or less patent.461 Nineteen462 we can only venture to mark “anonymous,” though Picander is probably present in most of them.  Ten are unaltered congregational hymns.463 There remain, however, five464 in which, perhaps, we detect another, and the last, of Bach's literary helpers.\",\n",
       " \"Wustmann draws attention465 to the libretto of Cantata No. 38, a paraphrase of Luther's Psalm 130.  He finds in it, and reasonably, an expression of “Jesus religion” very alien to Picander's muse, and suggests the younger Christian Weiss as the author of it.  Like his father, he was Bach's colleague, the godfather of his daughter, and undoubtedly on terms of close friendship with him.  But if he wrote the libretto of Cantata No. 38, probably it is not the only one.  The same note rings in four more of the Choral Cantatas,466 which may be attributed tentatively to Weiss, though their ascription to Bach would be equally congruous.\",\n",
       " 'Returning, however, to the seventy-two libretti of the later Leipzig period we reach this result: More than half of them (thirty-nine) are congregational hymns, all but two of which are of the paraphrased type in which we detect the work of Picander, Bach himself, and perhaps the younger Weiss.  Of the remaining thirty-three original libretti Marianne von Ziegler heads the list with nine, and perhaps ten.467  Bach follows with a problematical[pg 185]six,468 Picander with five,469 the elder Weiss with four,470 Neumeister with one.471 One text is taken from the Bible.472 Another consists of a single stanza of a hymn by Martin Behm.473 Five are by authors unknown or undetected.474',\n",
       " \"But, as was said at the outset, the attribution of particular libretti to individual writers is conjectural, except in comparatively few cases.  Yet, unsatisfying as it is, this guess-work reveals with approximate correctness the extent to which Bach drew upon his own and other people's abilities for the texts he needed.  Summarising our conclusions, we discover that about one-quarter (fifty-four) of the 202 libretti set by Bach between the years 1704 and 1744 were provided by the hymn-book.  It is shown elsewhere475 that all but eleven of them are taken from Paul Wagner's volumes.  The elder Weiss comes next with thirty-three libretti.  Bach follows with thirty, Salomo Franck with twenty-one, Picander with twenty (exclusive of his arrangements of Choral Cantata texts).  Marianne von Ziegler contributes ten, Neumeister seven, Eilmar and Helbig two each, Gottsched and Martin Behm one each.  Three libretti are taken from the Bible or Church liturgy.  Eighteen remain anonymous.\",\n",
       " \"The literary qualities of the libretti are not under discussion here.  They have a characteristic, however, on which one cannot forbear from remarking.  Indifferent literature as, for the most part, they are—children of their period and blemished with its imperfections—they enshrine an extraordinarily interesting anthology of the religious poetry of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.  They expose the evangelical thought of Germany from the age of Luther to that of Bach,[pg 186]and are particularly rich in the lyrical fervour of the Reformation itself.  Of the seventy-seven hymn-writers whom Bach includes in his collection, so many as forty-four belong to the sixteenth century.  Only thirteen of them touch Bach's own period.  And a similar bias to the Reformation epoch is observable in his choice of the tunes of the Chorals, which are absent from only twenty-one of the Cantatas.  By far the greater number of them are coeval with the hymns themselves; that is, they date from the Reformation and behind it.\",\n",
       " \"Here clearly is the source of Bach's inspiration, the master-key of his art.  He touches Luther, is in a sense his complement, his art builded on the foundations Luther laid, consecrated to the ends Luther vindicated, inspired by a dedication of himself to God's service not less exalted—a great artist, a great Protestant, a great man.476\",\n",

A secondary object, the foundation of a Bach Museum at Eisenach, in the house in which Bach was born, already has been achieved.

With two exceptions, the gift of composition appears to have been possessed, or exercised, solely by Heinrich Bach (see Table VI.), his two sons Johann Christoph and Johann Michael, already discussed, and his grandson, Johann Nikolaus (son of Johann Christoph).  Heinrich Bach was a very productive composer in all forms of musical art employed at that time in church (Sp. i. 36).  His grandson, Johann Nikolaus, composed a Mass and a comic operetta (ib., 132 ff.). The only other Bach composer known to Spitta is Georg Christoph, founder of the Franconian Bachs (see Table IV.) and Cantor at Themar and Schweinfurt (ib. 155).

The youthful Bach, aged fifteen in 1700, no doubt seized the earliest opportunity to relieve his brother of the charge of him.  Moreover, Johann Christoph's family was increasing (see Table V.).  In spite of the story of Bach's midnight copying, it cannot be questioned that he owed a good deal to his brother, who not only taught him but, presumably, maintained him at the Ohrdruf Lyceum, where Bach acquired a sound education and a considerable knowledge of Latin.

The choir library was particularly rich in the best church music of the period, both German and Italian.  Spitta is of opinion that Bach's talents as a violinist and Clavier player were also laid under contribution.  His voice, as Forkel states, soon ceased to be serviceable.

He made more than one visit, on foot, to Hamburg.  F. W. Marpurg published, in 1786, the story, which he received from Bach himself, that on one of his journeys from Hamburg, Bach sat down outside an inn and hungrily sniffed the savours from its kitchen.  His pockets were empty and there seemed little prospect of a meal, when a window was opened and two herring heads were thrown out.  Bach picked them up eagerly, and found in each of them a Danish ducat.  Who was his benefactor he never discovered; the gift enabled him to satisfy his hunger and pay another visit to Hamburg.\",\n",

Bach was drawn to Arnstadt chiefly by the fact that the New Church recently had been equipped with a particularly fine Organ (specification in Spitta, i. 224), which existed until 1863.

       " \"Bach's stipend at Arnstadt was not inconsiderable, and his duties engaged him only at stated hours on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays.  He, therefore, had leisure and the means to employ it.  In October 1705 he obtained four weeks' leave of absence and set off on foot to Lübeck, after leaving an efficient deputy behind him.  He stayed away until February 1706.  On his return the Consistory demanded an explanation of his absence, and took the opportunity to remonstrate with him on other matters.  They charged him “with having been hitherto in the habit of making surprising variationes in the Chorals, and intermixing divers strange sounds, so that thereby the congregation were confounded.”  They charged him with playing too long preludes, and after this was notified to him, of making them too short.  They reproached him “with having gone to a wineshop last Sunday during sermon,” and cautioned him that, “for the future he must behave quite differently and much better than he has done hitherto” (see the whole charge in Spitta, i. 315 ff.).  Bach also was on bad terms with the choir, whose members had got out of hand and discipline.  Before his Lübeck visit he engaged in a street brawl with one of the scholars.  Then, as later, he was a choleric gentleman.  In November 1706 he got into further trouble for having “made music” in the church with a “stranger maiden,” presumably his cousin Maria Barbara Bach, then on a visit to Arnstadt; he married her a year later.  Clearly the relations between the Consistory and the brilliant young Organist were becoming difficult, and Bach's migration to Mühlhausen no doubt was grateful to both.  His resignation was made formally on June 29, 1707.\",\n",

He also composed Cantatas 131 and 196 at Muhlhausen, and perhaps three others. See infra, p. 188.\",\n",

Bach mentions the Weimar post as having been offered to him, but bases his desire to resign the organ of St. Blasius, partly on the ground that his income was inadequate, partly because, though he had succeeded in improving the organ and the conditions of music generally, he saw “not the slightest appearance that things will be altered” for the better.  Mühlhausen, in fact, was a stronghold of Pietism and unsympathetic to Bach's musical ideals.\",\n",

The increase in his income early in 1714 also supports the conclusion, while a letter of January 14, 1714, written by Bach, is not signed by him as Concertmeister.  It would seem that his promotion took place in the interval between the two letters.  As Concertmeister it was part of his duty to provide Cantatas for the church services.  Twenty-two were written by him at Weimar.  See infra, p. 188, for a list of them.\",\n",

Besides the visit to Halle, in 1713, to which Forkel alludes, Bach performed at Cassel in 1713 or 1714 before the future Frederick I. of Sweden, who presented him with a ring which he drew from his finger.  Bach's feet, an admirer recorded, “flew over the pedal-board as if they had wings.” In December 1714 he visited Leipzig and performed Cantata No. 61, Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland.  In 1716 he was again invited to Halle, and at about the same time performed at Meiningen. Forkel records the famous contest with Marchand, the French Organist, at Dresden in 1717.\",\n",

The latter's post was still vacant and a new and particularly large Organ (sixty-three speaking stops) was being erected.  The authorities pressed Bach to submit himself to the prescribed tests, and he complied so far as to compose a Cantata and to conduct a performance of it.  On his return to Weimar he received a formal invitation to accept the post.  After some correspondence Bach refused it, partly, perhaps chiefly, on the ground that the income was inadequate.  The refusal was answered by the groundless accusation that he had merely entertained the Halle proposal in order to bring pressure upon Weimar for a rise of salary.  The misunderstanding was cleared away by 1716, when Bach visited Halle again.  In the interval Zachau's post had been given to his pupil, Gottfried Kirchhoff.

       " \" Forkel's meaning can be made clear in the following manner: place the thumb and fingers of either hand upon the notes C D E F G of the pianoforte so that the three middle fingers lie more or less flat upon the keys; then draw back the three middle fingers until they form an arch having their tips approximately in a straight line with the tips of the thumb and little finger upon the keys.\",\n",

       " 'The Harpsichord, as its name implies, was an instrument whose strings were plucked by a plectrum. Bach preferred the older Clavier, or Clavichord, which could be regulated, as the other could not, by nicety of touch. See note, p. 68, infra.',\n",
       " \"Schweitzer (i. 208) points out that Bach's touch was modern, in that he realised that “singing tone” depends not only upon the manner in which the keys are struck, but, to a great extent, on the regulation of their ascent.\",\n",
       " \"Of Handel's touch, Burney writes (quoted by Rockstro, p. 349): “His touch was so smooth, and the tone of the instrument so much cherished, that his fingers seemed to grow to the keys.  They were so curved and compact when he played, that no motion, and scarcely the fingers themselves, could be discovered.”\",\n",
       " 'At the beginning of the seventeenth century, as Spitta points out (ii. 34), the art of fingering had not developed.  Speaking generally, neither thumb nor little finger was employed.  It was not until the beginning of the eighteenth century that a scientific method emerged, a development rendered necessary by the advance in the modes of musical expression.  C. P. E. Bach, quoted by Schweitzer (i. 206), puts this concisely: “My late father told me that in his youth he had heard great men who never used the thumb except when it was necessary to make big stretches.  But he lived in an epoch when there came about gradually a most remarkable change in musical taste, and therefore found it necessary to work out for himself a much more thorough use of the fingers, and especially of the thumb, which, besides performing other good services, is quite indispensable in the difficult keys, where it must be used as nature intends.”',\n",

       " 'No doubt the friend who prepared this trap for Bach was Johann Gottfried Walther.  His compositions frequently were characterised by intricacy.',\n",
       " \"Mozart had the same gift.  When visiting St. Thomas' School in 1789, he heard with astonishment a performance of Bach's Motet, Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied. “At the conclusion he expressed his delight, and said, ‘Now that is something from which a man may learn.’  On being informed that Bach was Cantor to this school, and that his Motets were venerated there as reliques, he was eager to see them.  No score being to be obtained, they handed him the separate parts, and it was interesting to observe his manner of reading them, holding some in his hands, some on his knees, placing some on chairs around him; seeming thoroughly lost to everything, and not rising till he had thoroughly satisfied his curiosity” (Holmes, Life of Mozart, ed. Dent, p. 251). \",\n",
       " \"There were in Bach's time three “Clavier” instruments in use.  The oldest, the Clavichord, as a rule, had two strings to every note, set in motion by a “tangent” striking them from below.  Its advantage was that it permitted the tone to be regulated by the touch.  For that reason, though its tone was weak, Bach preferred it.  The Clavicembalo, or Harpsichord, as it is called in the text, was in general known as the “Flügel,” the strings being plucked, or flipped by a quill or metal pin, after the manner of the modern mandoline. The third instrument was the “piano e forte,” or Hammerclavier.The Clavicembalo was also built with two keyboards, like an Organ, and a pedal-board provided with strings.  It was for this instrument that the so-called Organ Sonatas of Bach were written.  He possessed five Clavicembali, but not a single Clavichord at the time of his death.  For that reason it has been questioned whether Forkel is accurate in stating that Bach preferred the latter instrument. See Schweitzer, i. 200 ff.\",\n",

       " \"Johann Adolph Scheibe, a native of Leipzig, was an unsuccessful candidate for the Organistship of St. Thomas' Church in 1729.  Bach was one of the judges.  In 1737 Scheibe published in the “Kritische Musikus” a criticism of Bach which, while doing justice to his powers as an organist, characterised his compositions as “turgid and confused in character.”  Bach was incensed by the criticism and asked his friend, Professor Birnbaum of Leipzig, to answer it.  Scheibe replied in 1739, with a wholly unjustified challenge of Bach's general education and culture. In his “Phoebus and Pan,” performed in 1731, Bach had already had the satisfaction of representing Scheibe as “Midas” and calling him an ass.  On the whole matter see Schweitzer, i. 178 ff. and Spitta, iii. 252.  Scheibe conducted the Court orchestra at Copenhagen from 1742-49 and died there in 1776.\",\n",

Dent, p. 11) is relevant: “My father would never let me learn the piano; if he had, no doubt I should have joined the noble army of piano thumpers…Sometimes I regret my ignorance, yet, when I think of the ghastly heap of platitudes for which that unfortunate piano is made the daily excuse—insipid, shameless productions, that would be impossible if their perpetrators had to rely, as they ought, on pencil and paper alone—then I thank the fates for having forced me to compose silently and freely by saving me from the tyranny of finger-work, that grave of original thought.”',\n",

Hence, he agrees with Spitta, Bach's way of working was quite different from Beethoven's.  With Beethoven the work developed by means of episodes that are independent of the theme.

But if we realise what harmony is, a means to extend and emphasise musical expression, we cannot imagine it apart from melody.

It might perhaps be reasonable to say of a composer that his influence was restricted to the sphere of melody, because we may get melody without harmony.  But there cannot be real harmony without melody.  Hence the composer who has perfected harmony has influenced the whole, whereas the melodist has left his mark only on a fraction of his art. \",\n",

When I am, as it were, completely myself, entirely alone, and of good cheer—say, travelling in a carriage, or walking after a good meal, or during the night when I cannot sleep; it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly. Whence and how they come, I know not; nor can I force them. Thoseideas that please me I retain in memory, and am accustomed, as I have been told, to hum them to myself.  If I continue in this way, it soon occurs to me how I may turn this or that morsel to account, so as to make a good dish of it, that is to say, agreeably to the rules of counterpoint, to the peculiarities of the various instruments, etc.  All this fires my soul, and, provided I am not disturbed, my subject enlarges itself, becomes methodised and defined, and the whole, though it be long, stands almost complete and finished in my mind, so that I can survey it, like a fine picture or a beautiful statue, at a glance.  Nor do I hear in my imagination the parts successively, but I hear them, as it were, all together.  What a delight this is I cannot tell!…When I proceed to write down my ideas, I take out of the bag of my memory, if I may use that phrase, what has previously been collected into it in the way I have mentioned.  For this reason the committing to paper is done quickly enough, for everything is, as I said before, already finished; and it rarely differs on paper from what it was in my imagination” (Life, ed.

It is, however, exceedingly doubtful whether Bach wrote more than four Passions.  Only those according to St. Matthew and St. John have come down to us from C. P. E. Bach, who was left the Autographs of both by his father.  The St. John Passion was first performed in 1724 and the St. Matthew Passion in 1729. Picander, Bach's librettist, certainly wrote two other Passion texts, one of which was written for Good Friday 1725, and the second, based on St. Mark's Gospel, was actually performed at St. Thomas', Leipzig, on Good Friday 1731.  Spitta (ii. 505) gives good reason to hold that Bach's music for this Passion was adapted from the Trauer-Ode, which he had written in 1727 in memory of Queen Christiane Eberhardine.  But of the 1725 Passion there is no trace.  If it ever existed, its loss probably may be assigned to Wilhelm Friedemann's carelessness, to whom presumably it was assigned in the division of Bach's property after his death.

There exists, however, a fifth Passion according to St. Luke, which is undoubtedly in Bach's Autograph, and which Spitta is inclined to attribute to Bach himself.
